They are knowledgeable about their systems  but not necessarily sophisticated about climate science or risk management. They may be addressing a  myriad of issues that require immediate attention and have limited time to focus on adaptation planning  for the future. Furthermore, they may need to adapt to climate change impacts within their organizations  existing resources. Despite these challenges, managers who realize that climate change will affect their  ability to meet their goals will see the need to incorporate climate change risk into their planning.",GUIDE PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES,Guide Purpose Statement,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,727,Set Goals and Objectives

However, the Workbook was designed with environmental professionals who manage  watersheds or coastal places and protect the health of aquatic  ecosystems as its main audience. This Workbook assumes that  users:   represent an organization that has environmental goals or  objectives;  start with some sense that climate change will pose a threat  to what their organization is trying to accomplish;  are comfortable using science to inform decision-making; and  have sufficient knowledge of their environmental system (or can partner with those who do) to  understand how climate changes may affect the way it functions.",GUIDE PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES,Guide Purpose Statement,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,749,Set Goals and Objectives
66,"Vulnerability Assessments A vulnerability assessment is an understanding of how climate change will uniquely affect your  organization. The organization is the center of attention, and the reasons why it exists (i.e., its purpose,  mission, goals or objectives) are the base units of the vulnerability assessment.  Organizational goals are the focus of concern. Goals are why organizations exist and what motivates  them; goals provide a context for changes. The vulnerability assessment half of a risk-based adaptation  plan is different from a climate change impacts study that describes how the future will be different if  the climate is different. An impact that is identified without reference to a goal is just a detail. There is no  context to say it is good or bad or that something should be done about it or not. Context comes from  people or organizations. They can say that an impact will help, hurt or have no effect on what they are  trying to do (Table I-1). If impacts will be unwanted, goals might still be attainable if risk-reducing actions  can be implemented.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1081,Set Goals and Objectives

71,"Action Plans An action plan is a document that explains how you will manage your climate change risks. After  completing a vulnerability assessment, you will have identified the risks that have the highest potential to  affect your organizations ability to meet its goals.  The vulnerability assessment process helped you decide which risks to focus on. Now you will identify  actions that might help to decrease those risks and increase the sustainability of your system. Making  these decisions when you have limited resources and probably cannot mitigate all of your risks will not  be easy. Pursuing win-win solutions or no-regrets actions will be appealing options that make sense  regardless of what the future brings.

You want to uncover any  circumstances that might guide you to choose  certain adaptation approaches or prevent you  from selecting others.

105,"Is mitigation realistic? Mitigating a risk means acting in a way to modify its likelihood or consequence. Right now you simply  want to increase your understanding of the types of actions that would be necessary to lower your risks. BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 57 Step 7 You want to get yourself to the point where you can say that it is realistic to think that a risk could be  lowered if you elected to work on it: then you can make a more informed decision about whether you  want to mitigate each risk or take a different approach. The Climate Ready Estuaries Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas, as well as other  documents (see the Additional Resources section of this step and Step 8a), will provide a sense for  what might work for your location and combination of risks. You might also recognize that some actions  address more than one risk.  While you will not be selecting actions in this step, having some familiarity  with ones your organization could take will be helpful. A fair amount of  work remains in Step 8a and Step 8b before you will select a specific  mitigation technique to use. Do not be too critical right now. In the same  way the Workbook advises not to dismiss risks while you are preparing  your vulnerability assessment, you should not dismiss actions here right  now. You will be tempted to bring in your organizations context or other  knowledge to eliminate possible actions. However, judgments about how  realistic something is will be coming back into this very soon.  For this part of Step 7, just understand what kind of mitigating actions are  in circulation and use your professional knowledge to simply think about  whether any would work to lower your risks if you (or someone else) could  implement them",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1771,Develop Strategies and Actions
106,"Approaches for each risk Although these decisions will be made at a high level, you are deciding an approach for risks that  you determined have the potential to affect your organizations ability to meet its goals. You need to  be prudent as well as aware that how you choose to approach your risks will determine where your  adaptation actions are focused going forward. Your context and constraints will have a big influence on the approach you select. It will be helpful to  consult partners and stakeholders as you determine the approach for each risk. Some risks may be very  important to a stakeholder group, or work may already be underway to address other risks. It will also be  helpful to consider the spatial scale of the impact. You may opt for a different approach depending on  whether it affects a small or large area.  Risk management uses four general approaches for responding to any given risk:  Mitigate.  Transfer.  Accept.  Avoid. Mitigating a risk is the one approach in which your organization would be making changes to the risk  path (Step 3). The other approaches handle risk more administratively.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1125,Develop Strategies and Actions
108,"Transfer Transfer is a technical risk management term for having another organization take responsibility for  reducing the risk. Your risk is mitigated by another party. Buying an insurance policy is an example of  transferring risk by having another party reduce the consequences if the risk occurs. An environmental  management organization will probably not be buying insurance policies, but transfers can occur when  other organizations will act in ways to reduce your risks. Maybe your risk could be mitigated when a  highway is rebuilt or as part of other infrastructure work. Maybe you can agree to lead a reforestation  effort if a partner agrees to restore some other habitat. Maybe some agency has announced it will  be taking hazard mitigation actions that would have the co-benefit of reducing some of your risk. If  others actions are lowering the likelihood or consequence of your risks then you have transferred the  risk reduction responsibility to them. You arent mitigating the risk, but it is being reduced. Note that  you cannot unilaterally transfer a risk. Other organizations need to affirm that they will actually mitigate  the risk; otherwise the risk will still be there. You can opt to transfer some of a risk by partnering with  another organization or by making a financial contribution to someone elses mitigation project. If you  are working with partner organizations on your adaptation plan, this is an opportunity to decide which  organization is going to be the lead for which risks.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1519,Develop Strategies and Actions
109,"Accept You may have to consider accepting a risk if you are unable to mitigate or transfer it through a viable  strategy. Accepting a risk means that your organization will continue with business as usual and run the  risk, dealing with the impact if/when it does occur. You might choose to accept a risk for some time,  and then later begin to work on mitigating it. Reasons to accept a risk could include a long time horizon  before impacts are expected, inability to locate a suitable mitigation strategy, or a lack of worry about  the consequence of the risk. If more resources or information become available, you can re-evaluate and  decide if there is an opportunity to use another approach besides accept for a risk.  If you dont make a choice to use any other approach, then by default you have elected to accept a risk.  You are running the risk",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,855,Develop Strategies and Actions
110,"Avoid The mitigate/transfer/accept approaches assume that you do not want to change your organizations  goals. If those three approaches are not feasible for you, then you may want to avoid a risk by narrowing  goals that are related to this risk. Avoiding is about being out of the risk altogether so it will not affect  you. Typically, avoiding a risk involves eliminating its root cause. However, since your organization by  itself will not stop climate change from occurring, and since you cannot relocate your place, avoiding  a risk in this context would require a shift in your organizations operations or goals so that you are no  longer exposed to that risk. For example, if one of your goals is to maintain some resource, but you  conclude that climate change is making that a lost cause, you could relinquish that goal. Avoiding a  risk does not mean the impact to the resource or to your place goes awaythis is an administrative  handling of risk in which you move away from this objective and you will no longer put resources toward  it. Avoiding a risk may be a radical move for an organization: you will be pulling back from work that you  thought was important. Reserve this approach for risks that will not be mitigated (by you or others) and  where accepting the risk is a bad proposition.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1307,Develop Strategies and Actions
111,"Avoid vs. accept The Workbook often states that if more information becomes available you should go back to earlier  steps. In the iterative process of risk management, choosing avoid for a risk appears to be something  new that has lots of other implications for your adaptation plan. If you are renouncing a goal, then all the  risks you identified in Step 3, which derive from that goal, would seem to vanish too. Thus those risks  would fall out of your matrix and vulnerability assessment. If they are not in your vulnerability assessment,  they would not make it into this step of action planning either. Logically, deciding to avoid a risk makes it  and everything related to it disappear. Instead of acting right away on this logic, you should let your choice of avoid sit for now. The  implications to your risks and goals arising from an iteration do not go away but are not an immediate  problem. Instead, you want to leave open the possibility that even more information could be coming.  The risk may turn out to be more benign than you thought; a new risk mitigation technology might  emerge; a new partner may agree to help you with the risk; windfall funding might come in; etc. If you  expunge the risk and the goal from your vulnerability assessment and action plan, you have nothing to  go back to if you do get more information. Keep the risk and the goal, and keep track of the fact that  you chose to avoid the risk. Things might change that would eventually let you select a mitigate/transfer/ accept approach.  Tracking a risk you choose to avoid keeps a goal on the books. You stop working on the goal itself but  do not drop it completely. Pragmatically, it really does not matter what your goal is or is not if you are  not going to put any resources into trying to reach it. The difference between the accept and avoid  approaches to a climate change risk thus become the difference between business as usual toward a  goal and no action toward a goal.

113,"Further, if the climate changes faster than you expect or if you were too optimistic in your time horizon  determination, then by the time you complete another iteration of your vulnerability assessment, these  unwanted risks may already be upon you.  If you are not sure about mitigation: You are not obligated to start responding, but if you think you  would want to mitigate a risk in the future, then you could benefit from the risk management process  now by assigning it to the mitigation approach. In the systematic risk management process, only those  risks that you identify for mitigation will be carried forward to Step 8a and Step 8b, where you will select  adaptation actions for the risks, and to Step 9, where you will develop your plan. The other riskswhich  you are deciding not to actively mitigate but to transfer/accept/avoidwill be picked up in Step 10 Monitoring and Review after you write your plan. If Step 8a and Step 8b show you that there is not a  viable mitigation strategy for a particular risk, you can return to this step and choose another approach",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1081,Develop Strategies and Actions
114,"Approving the approach After you have investigated and chosen a high-level approach (mitigate/transfer/accept/avoid) for every  one of your risks, your organizations key decision-makers (board of directors, management committee,  staff, and the people who are regularly involved with deciding what you do) should agree before you go  further with your action plan. Your organization is preparing a major strategy document. While this is not  a new strategic plan, it is a statement of how you plan to continue being able to achieve your mission  and goals.  If you selected the avoid approach for any of your risks, you need to carefully think through what this  means. You have chosen to withdraw from whatever goal would be thwarted by the risk. This may be  the whole goal if the goal is narrow (e.g., maintain critical habitat for a particular bird species), or it may  be a part of a goal if the goal is broad (e.g., maintain ecological diversity in your watershed). If you are  deciding to withdraw from pursuing a goal (and thereby in effect rewriting your strategic plan), key  decision-makers should approve this change in course.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1139,Develop Strategies and Actions
116,"Finding mitigating actions that look promising As you find the points along a risk pathway where opportunities exist to mitigate the risk (Figure 8a-3),  you need to rely on your knowledge about your system to think about what actions might be promising.  You are looking for actions to apply at the relevant spots in the risk path in order to lower the likelihood  or consequence of a risk. Your professional knowledge and training may lead you in certain directions. As you were familiarizing  yourself with options in Step 7, additional ideas may have interested you. If your organization goals are  similar to the Clean Water Act goals, then Table 8a-1 of the Workbook presents the actions from CREs  Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas in a new format that you might find useful. If your  organization has goals specific to the management of water utilities, see resources from EPAs Climate  Ready Water Utilities program. For other sets of organizational goals, the Additional Resources section  at the end of this step points to sources of potential actions.  There are hundreds of potential actions that would alter a risk path and reduce the risks consequence/ probability. Many actions are trivial; some are practically impossible. You want to identify a plausible  range of actions in this step. This is probably not as open-ended a brainstorming exercise as it sounds,  but do not reject things that are novel. You want a range of actions because in Step 8b you may decide  that some are unpalatable for various reasons and should be rejected. Having a plausible range of  actions will help you find opportunities to use actions that might mitigate more than one risk, bring  co-benefits, or open up other opportunities. The best way to solve one particular risk might not be  as advantageous as a second-best way that mitigates other risks too. It is fine (probably desirable) to  identify the same action for more than one risk",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A2 - EPA 2014 risk based adaptation planning_workbook,Climate Adaptation,1955,Develop Strategies and Actions
121,"A planning-level plan In this last planning-level step, you will create the  mechanisms to ensure that you make progress. You want  to create two risk management tracking systems. One  tracks the actions; the other tracks the risks. You will create  two tables that start as inverses of each other. Each table  should be updated regularly. The first table (Table 9-1) tracks the actions and notes  which risks they are associated with as well as who has  responsibility for implementing them. An action may  address more than one risk. The second table (Table 9-2) keeps track of your risks and  notes what actions are being used and when they are  completed. A risk may be affected by more than one  action.

In doing so, an informed set of stakeholders may be equipped to add great  value to the critical thinking behind Focus Area prioritization (see Chapter 2.3).",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,A4 - FL 2018 Adaptation Planning Guidebook,Climate Adaptation,577,Set Goals and Objectives
319,"2.3. Assign Focus Areas With the assistance of the steering  committee and community stake- holders, the planning team may  assign Focus Areas. This sub-com- ponent builds on the identification  of sensitive entities in the previous  step and assigns community pref- erences to areas that will receive a  majority of the adaptation strategy attention. The Focus Areas help  the community designate areas to start their adaptation process and  narrow the field to build a track record of implementation. Deciding on Focus Areas is a step where the planning team engages  the community to address the findings from the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. It is recommended that before the Vulnerability Assess- ment begins, criteria be established to guide the publics input (e.g.,  Focus Areas are established where critical facilities or infrastructure  are located and/or where the highest affected population resides).  To do this, it is important to convey information about the potential  affected entities to both steering committee members and community  stakeholders and to record their feedback about what should become  a Focus Area and why. Preferential areas which receive steering com- mittee and community attention may then be deemed Focus Areas  that can benefit from adaptation strategies directed toward them  using the following components.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,A4 - FL 2018 Adaptation Planning Guidebook,Climate Adaptation,1359,Set Goals and Objectives
356,"Focus Areas Once the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses have been conducted, a  community may translate these findings into map-designated areas  that constitute the boundaries of the Focus Areas. Focus Areas should  be based upon the findings generated during the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. Focus Areas can be defined on a map according to the  following characteristics: a specific geographic area (e.g., development  along coastlines), certain vulnerable populations or communities (e.g.,  the elderly and climate-related health risks), natural and built systems  (e.g., local stormwater drainage systems and infrastructure), and other  assets identified and quantified during the Sensitivity Analysis.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,A4 - FL 2018 Adaptation Planning Guidebook,Climate Adaptation,714,Set Goals and Objectives

A vulnerabil- ity assessment can support many local planning efforts in addition to  adaptation planning. As such, resources could be shared to support  the development of a vulnerability assessment that could be inte- grated into multiple local plans.

361,"3.2. Prioritize Adaptation Needs Once the adaptive capacities of the local community have been identi- fied, a prioritization framework can follow. At this point in the planning  process, the community should be aware of the impacts of potential  sea level rise and inland flooding, have identified its focus areas to  address the impacts, and/or have inventoried the capacity of the com- munity to adapt. It is at this step that the community combines those  findings and creates a short list of its biggest challenges to determine  what can feasibly be done where and when.16 Articulating a communitys biggest challenges to sea level rise is a nec- essary step in identifying adaptation needs. For example: The most  important challenge facing the local agency is adequately address- ing the current state of the wastewater treatment plant which is at  increased risk to flooding or Elevating the many bridges in the local  agencys jurisdiction to withstand 2 feet of sea level rise is our high- est priority. Prioritizing adaptation needs sets the stage for the next  sub-component  creating specific adaptation strategies. Prioritization can be as simple as selecting the needs that can be  addressed currently (using capacities already identified as robust in the  Assess Adaptive Capacity step or categorized as low-hanging fruit)  and saving the more involved solutions for later. Conversely, it may  be more important for a local agency to tackle large-scale expected  impacts first, regardless of cost and complication, due to urgency",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,A4 - FL 2018 Adaptation Planning Guidebook,Climate Adaptation,1543,Develop Strategies and Actions
364,"Accommodation strategies alter physical design to allow the structure  or land use to stay in place. Examples of this are floodable develop- ment, floating structures, and increased stormwater storage via imple- mentation of Low Impact Development or Green infrastructure (LID/ GI) in upstream locations. LID/GI upstream improvements reduce  downstream flows by allowing more stormwater to infiltrate in place,  thereby taking the pressure off the existing downstream stormwater  infrastructure. In the Netherlands, a concept known as Room for the  River helps dictate land use compatible with periodic flooding being  designated adjacent to all major Dutch rivers.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Physical Infrastructure,A4 - FL 2018 Adaptation Planning Guidebook,Climate Adaptation,665,Develop Strategies and Actions
365,"Retreat from areas or infrastructure where protection or accommoda- tion will not be efficient or effective can be voluntary, incentivized, or  done gradually. It can also involve new building designs in vulnerable  areas to be altered or moved when appropriate in the future. Com- munities can also plan for an eventual retreat from barrier islands and  coastal high hazard areas but, in the meantime, continue to invest  in assets in a limited fashion based on that assets expected lifetime  and projected inundation. It is important to note that communication  about retreat can be difficult. The language used to convey adaptation  strategies can make a difference in how communities react to propos- als. The term retreat often conveys a defeat, which can deter stake- holders from embracing the strategy. They may instead fight it. Other  possible terms to use include managed relocation and realign- ment. Home buyout programs, rolling easements, and land swaps are  a few possible mechanisms that communities can investigate in order  to implement managed retreat.

Since capital infrastructure is devel- oped and maintained for a relatively long lifespan, planning for future  changes in sea level should be a part of initial design or incorporated  when plans are due for periodic update. City and County Land Devel- opment Regulations and Codes, as well as zoning regulations, can be  used to direct development and redevelopment to more suitable areas  where flooding and erosion are less troublesome.

An  optional but highly recommended  tool for adaptation strategies, AAAs  lend themselves to a flexible form  of zoning overlay that delineates  the physical areas where certain measures, restrictions, or prioritized  funding would apply. It is especially beneficial to designate AAAs now  because local agencies currently have the option to devise criteria  for their designation and the flexibility to edit them as circumstances  change.

Communities that have already gone through this process have also  identified the value of doing a business as usual baseline assessment18 that will help compare the costs anticipated by the adaptation strategies.

Below is a list of eight planning prod- ucts that may already exist in a local community that are appropriate  to amend with adaptation planning strategies.19 A Local Comprehensive Plan (LCP) is required of all Florida counties  and municipalities, guiding future growth and development. LCP pol- icies generally influence a communitys day-to-day land use decisions  and capital facilities expenditures. These policies play a major role in  determining local development patterns, which in turn determine the  degree to which people and property are exposed to natural hazards,  injury, and damage. Examples of communities who have already incor- porated AAAs in their LCP are included in Chapter 3.6, Best Practices. Florida local agencies are now required to integrate or add accom- modations for the 2015 Peril of Flood Statute [163.3178(2)(f) 1-6]  into their Local Comprehensive Plan. Signed into law by Governor Rick  Scott on May 21, 2015, this requirement should be contained in a new  or existing redevelopment component of their coastal management  planning element. This component should eliminate inappropriate and  unsafe development in the coastal areas when opportunities arise.",IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING,Plan Compliance and Integration,NA,A4 - FL 2018 Adaptation Planning Guidebook,Climate Adaptation,1332,Adapt and Update Plan
412,"Once a set of adaptation strategies has been developed and analyzed, it  is time to transition to implementation activities to move the strategies  from plan to action. This process includes identifying, preparing for, and  applying for potential funding opportunities; creating a schedule of adap- tation actions for the future; and monitoring and evaluating progress. Implementation strategies are the specific steps a community takes to  incorporate the adaptation strategies into existing planning, budgeting,  and staffing mechanisms. The Assess Adaptive Capacities sub-com- ponent (Chapter 3.1) should outline the ability of the community to  take action. Even before the Vulnerability Assessment is conducted,  communities may want to consider possible implementation strate- gies based on available capacities, existing implementation schedules,  or available funding sources. Communities must be able to support  and implement adaptation activities to successfully reduce the neg- ative impacts of potential sea level rise that were identified during a  Vulnerability Assessment. The ability to implement can increase over  time, so communities should not simply settle for what is available at  the current time but expect that, as they undertake the first round of  implementation, their knowledge and capacity will grow. The Implementation Strategies component contains most of the adap- tation plans logistics  the actions and functions that need to take  place for the product (adaptation strategies) to be delivered.

421,"4.5. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation Outreach can be one of the most important activities within a program  because it can lead to municipal action in the future. Increased stake- holder engagement throughout the adaptation planning process can  help to create buy-in amongst the public which can then in turn lead  to greater political support for adaptation actions in the community.  Holding public meetings, forums, or workshops that include business  groups, residents, and other community stakeholders can provide an  opportunity to educate participants and receive feedback based on  their understanding of local vulnerabilities to sea level rise and poten- tial responses. It can also be used as an opportunity to establish a con- nection between incremental improvements to citizen and property  safety and welfare and a more desirable future community. Participatory monitoring efforts can help the community observe  unanticipated coastal flooding impacts and effects of adaptation strat- egies. Stakeholder feedback can be used to gauge community satisfac- tion with adaptation strategies and their implementation and provide  a forum for addressing new concerns as they arise. These two partic- ipatory activities will continue after the initial planning effort is com- plete and may be integrated with other ongoing monitoring and evalu- ation mechanisms to ensure that continued attention is paid to them.

550,"Zoning Intended to create a healthy, safe, and orderly  community while balancing a diversity of interests,  ideally as envisioned by a comprehensive plan, zoning is  one of the most commonly used methods of regulating  land use. A number of the measures discussed in this  guide can be implemented through zoning.  Zoning can be used to regulate parcel use, density of  development, building dimensions, setbacks, impervious  surfaces, type of construction (e.g., easily movable),  shore protection structures, landscaping, etc. It can also  be used to regulate where development can and cannot  take place, making it an invaluable tool in efforts to  protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive  areas and guide development away from hazard-prone  areas. Permissible uses and standards vary by zoning  district. Types of districts include general use districts;  overlay districts, where provisions in addition to those  on the underlying districts apply; and special use  districts, in which all uses require permits.  Floodplain zoning is an example of a zoning application  that, if thoughtfully drafted, can provide multiple  benefits. In addition to protecting life and property,  benefits of floodplain zoning can include resource  conservation, open space preservation, public access,  and water-quality protection.

The actual acquisition may  take place in advance of a hazard event or in the wake  of one, when funding, and willingness to sell, may be  easier to come by and when eminent domain may come  into play. Typically, relocation involves acquiring land and  relocating structures out of harms way rather than  demolishing them. Some relocation projects, for  example, where the majority of the structures are  substantially damaged or destroyed, may involve  demolition along with active efforts to relocate people  into new homes in safer areas. Relocation may occur  at different scales. It may involve moving individual  structures or moving neighborhoods. In some cases, it  may even involve moving entire communities.

The discussion here focuses on the use  of setbacks largely for the purpose of protecting  structures from hazards by keeping the structures  away from a propertys most vulnerable areas.

Subdivision  regulations can require lots to be deep enough  to accommodate initial setbacks as well as future  relocations. And, building codes can ensure  structures can be moved with relative ease. Setbacks may be regulated at the state or local level, or  both, and may be based on size or use. Typically, they  require structures to be sited at a distance measured  inland from a specific shoreline feature, such as a high  water mark, vegetation line, dune toe, or bluff crest.

These projects should be designed to withstand the  impacts of climate change, incorporating native  species that will be able to adapt to anticipated future  conditions. The focus should be on maintaining and  enhancing connectivity and preserving ecosystem  functionality and services rather than re-creating  a specific species composition.

Any project designed to restore, establish, or  enhance an ecosystem will require planning, long- term management, monitoring, and, possibly,  land acquisition. In general, of the three project types,  restoration is the most likely to be successful (Interagency  Workgroup on Wetland Restoration 2004). The outcomes  of projects that create new ecosystems or new ecosystem  services are more uncertain, especially when the additional  uncertainties of climate change are factored in. Wetland  creation is usually difficult and typically requires a lot more  planning and effort than restoration projects.

With the strategy (goals and actions) in place and  the plan approved, focus on the actions the planning  team has selected. The action plans will guide the  implementation of the individual actions. One of the biggest challenges to the implementation of  climate change adaptation actions is funding. This will  likely require creativity and networking and will be an  ongoing effort. Currently, there is not a lot of funding  directly targeted at climate change adaptation. But, there  are a number of grant opportunities for restoration,  conservation, hazard mitigation, infrastructure (e.g.,  installing new/updating existing), and community and  economic development.  Think about how funds from multiple sources can  be combined as well as how you can work with other  jurisdictions (states and local governments), regional  organizations, and nongovernmental organizations to  pool resources to meet complementary needs. Planning  team members should think about the grants they have  applied for in the past and how these funding vehicles  might also support adaptation activities. Funding may  also be available through nonprofit organizations (e.g.,  environmental advocacy groups), private foundations,  and businesses. In addition to funding, these groups  may also be able to provide in-kind goods and services.

Some impacts, which  will occur regardless of climate change (e.g., hazard  events), may be easier to monitor than those that are  likely to occur more slowly over time, like sea level rise. Things to consider when designing the tracking and  evaluation process include:  How often should the planning team meet to  review the plan and discuss its progress?  How will the planning team keep elected  officials apprised of progress and obstacles?  How will progress be communicated to other  stakeholders outside of the planning team?  How should progress be reported (e.g., create a  progress report template for actions)?  Is the action complete?  If the action is ongoing, what was  accomplished during the reporting period?

741,"Create Prioritized List of Adaptation Actions Once the planning team has agreed upon the evaluation criteria, those criteria can be used to evaluate and select high  priority adaptation actions. There are multiple ways to do this. One way is to work through each action and assign a score  (e.g., 1 to 3, or 1 to 5) for each of the criterion for each adaptation action. Actions that score higher could be prioritized for  implementation. Note: Some categories, such as cost, may need to be scored in reverse (low cost = 3, high costs = 1) so that  the sum adequately helps prioritize lower costs actions if that is a goal for the tribe.  After evaluating adaptation actions using the selection  criteria, the planning team will decide how to rank the  actions. There are many ways to do this ranking. The  tribe could, for example, choose the top three adaptation  actions based on score, choose to pursue all actions that  exceed a minimum scoring threshold, or group actions  based on what can be done now or in the future (see call  out box). See Case Studies for additional examples. No matter what  approach is taken to evaluate and prioritize adaptation  actions, this is a great place in the process to set the  foundation for monitoring and evaluating (Step 5) the  success of those actions.

The climate change planning team has already helped identify actions relevant to their tribal departments. The key is to  start with a few small elements and move forward from planning to action. This will demonstrate tangible progress to  the community, tribal leadership, and potential funders, that can help create the momentum for tackling the harder, or  bigger, actions and changes identified in the plan.

Pilot projects have the benefit of not being seen  as permanent and frequently face lower political and financial barriers. If successful, a pilot project (limited in extent or  geographic scope) can rapidly be scaled or rolled out to other areas. Pilot projects demonstrate measurable success and  can:  Help identify obstacles, logistical challenges, and possible unintended consequences in a semi-controlled, small- scale context;  Help determine if goals and timelines are appropriate and that the appropriate tracking, monitoring, and  reporting takes place;  Provide a forum for gathering feedback from tribal members, staff, and leadership that can be used to inform the  full-scale roll out of the action; and  Secure tribal and staff buy-in. A pilot project isnt always necessary. A full-scale launch may be appropriate where similar adaptation actions have  been previously executed under similar conditions (for example, by other tribes, or in areas with similar geography and  topography) with successful results.

948,"ADJUSTMENT AND OUTREACH  Communicating with the community and inviting its collaboration throughout the  implementation process, both before and during adjustment, are critical to sustaining  ongoing adaptation. A community should not be surprised by changes in approach,  which should be communicated consistently as a normal part of long-term climate  adaptation strategy implementation. Without appropriate inclusion of the community  throughout the process, changing a strategy could be viewed as abandoning it or as  a failure of implementation rather than as a successful outcome of good monitoring  and evaluation. Sustained engagement with the community and transparency in  monitoring and evaluation can help avoid such misunderstandings, which can lead to  community dissatisfaction with adaptation actions. Additionally, community inclusion  can supplement the selection process for the new or bolstered strategy.June 2020 153 California Adaptation Planning Guide Some sample actions are:  Ensure that lessons learned and outcomes from review and monitoring of  implementation are publicly available.

1000,"PLAN OBJECTIVES AND ACTION MEASURES I t is important to note that the most successful  long-term coastal management programs set  unambiguous, quantifiable, time-bounded objec- tives, (in contrast to vague or open-ended goals).  Specific geographic areas that are of the highest risk, (either due to their low elevations or proximi- ties to retreating cliffs), should be mapped and de- lineated, and timelines should be established for  actions that are based on agreed-upon conditions  or thresholds. For example, by the time high tides  reach a certain elevation, a relocation plan has  been established and action is initiated. Further- more, when a retreating cliff or bluff edge erodes to within a certain distance of a street, sidewalk,  sewer or water line, a clear retreat plan has been  approved. The team should remember to focus primar- ily upon planned or proactive adaptation, as op- posed to reactive adaptation. Reactive adapta- tion includes changes in policy and behaviors that  people and organizations adopt after changes in  coastal risks are observed or communities have  already sustained damage. For example, as prop- erty losses from increasing wave heights and in- creasingly severe coastal storms and sea level  rise increase in frequency, insurance companies  will likely raise their rates or drop coverage alto- gether, resulting in a disincentive to live in hazard  zones. This has already begun to happen along the  hurricane-prone barrier islands that line the South  Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The  purpose of adapting to sea level rise, though, is to  avoid such problems altogether by planning ahead  for the future. In this way, planned adaptation is  intentional, rational, and it aims to address the full  range of sea level rise hazards such that it meets  societal objectives",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,A8 - CA 2012 Adapting to Sea Level Rise,Climate Adaptation,1834,Set Goals and Objectives

The  Team should recommend to decision-makers the  choices that are most likely to be successfully im- plemented.

1002,"There are three different types of future plan- ning or adaptation considerations for coastal  properties in most cities or counties:  1. Undeveloped parcels that are considered or  are zoned to be developable.  2. Existing unprotected development, including  residential and commercial areas as well as in- frastructure (i.e. streets, parking lots, parks,  bike paths, sewer or water lines, etc.). 3. Existing development that has already been  armored. A Team should be aware of the different adapta- tion strategies that are available for both existing  and planned future development. Some communi- ties have highly developed coastlines, while oth- ers that have some undeveloped land could take  advantage of the opportunity to address potential  future issues proactively.

Securing funding may be easiest during times when adaptation to sea  level rise is required by legislation and already on  the agenda of a local government or political body.  Typically, most action or legislation regarding nat- ural hazards takes place immediately following a  large and damaging event and then collective  amnesia sets in and other issues become higher  priorities than sea level rise adaptation planning.  Good examples include the 1989 Loma Prieta  earthquake, and the tsunamis resulting from the  2006 earthquake in Sumatra and in Japan in 2011.  As time passes, funding for area-wide adaptation,  for the execution of regulatory measures and  for those measures requiring large capital invest- ments and follow-up monitoring may be difficult to secure.

Evaluating progress in terms  of reducing vulnerability will be difficultinitially be- cause the impacts of a rising sea level and increas- ing storm wave climate may take years to become  obvious or recognizable. With a short timeframe,  it is also difficult to determine whether increased wave heights or larger storms are due to climate  change or just part of the normal range of climate  variability. In general, it is prudent to keep track  of any unexpected problems, obstacles or delays  associated with adaptation actions, as well as any  unintended positive or negative consequences. Another important consideration is that sea level  rise preparedness is a long-term and continuous  process. A Team must adjust its original assump- tions as natural, social, economic and political  conditions change. For instance, a Team will likely  come across new scientific information or data that could improve and possibly change its under- standing of its communitys vulnerability to sea  level rise. Science advisors should be consulted in  order to determine whether new findings are rel- evant to the community and its adaptive capacity  and whether they should influence changes in the Adaptation Plan",IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING,Evaluation and Monitoring,NA,A8 - CA 2012 Adapting to Sea Level Rise,Climate Adaptation,1492,Monitor and Evaluate Progress

Recall that the concept of risk encompasses the probability of a loss as well as the magnitude of the loss. Effective actions need to reduce one or both of these elements. Addressing this type of risk is called an expected value analysis. As was the case in earlier steps, some groups choose to engage risk management consultants to assist them with this process. You can decide if each action is a worthwhile investment by comparing the cost to implement it to the expected value of the benefit it will provide. If the total value of reduced risk, increased resilience, and co- benefits are expected to have a comparable or higher value than the cost of implementing the project, expected value is positive. Take a step: Compare the cost to implement each solution you listed to the expected value of the benefit it will provide. Be aware that estimating the potential financial benefit of intangible things such as ecosystem services can lead to a broad range of expected values. Also, in some cases, the expected value of reduced risk associated with an action may seem positive, but only because the action transfers or delays risk.

Does everyone understand the goal? Is it written in clear language? Are there multiple  ways to interpret the goal?    Who is responsible for implementation? Does the lead agency have influence or  ability to achieve the goal? Are the resources, skill, and knowledge available to achieve  the goal?   How does the team know when a goal has been achieved? Is there a milestone that  has been reached? An amount of money spent? An action achieved?   Can the jurisdictions involved realistically achieve that goal? If not, what is more likely?

Implementation can be considered in two parts:  Implementation is a critical part of sustaining resilience over the long-term, ensuring  ongoing support and funding for future projects and initiatives. Below are some best  practices to use as the project team develops implementation plans.    Connect implementation to the goals and process completed to get to this point.    Understand the needs and wants of stakeholders and community members.    Use survey and polling to gauge broad support for plans and actions.   Build support for the value of the plan to increase buy in and increase stakeholders  investment in the outcome.    Plan on a lot of ongoing public outreach and education to remind people about the  effort and how it connects to their lives.    Time projects when the atmosphere is right. Modify the timeframe identified in the  plan as needed to benefit from external conditions. A Long-Term Implementation Plan (5-20 years) is typically higher level, and used to  share with stakeholders and decision makers, is included in formal plan documents, and  illustrates how to achieve the vision and plan goals.  A Short-Term Action Plan (0-5 years) can act as a staff level working plan that details  each step or tactic necessary to achieve those longer term goals and vision in a more  manageable time frame, up to 2 years.

1328,"Develop an initial financial strategy that starts with locally-based funding opportu- nities. The strategy should consider the following elements:  Embed resilience budgeting into the communitys fiscal planning. As resilience funding  is often limited to external, limited scope grants or restricted portions of general fund  or capital improvement plan budgets, local resources are undervalued. This includes  existing budget planning as part of mainstream operations. Incrementally, resilience  projects and initiatives need to be part of the regular budget and decision-making  discussions.  Examine all funding sources at hand as possible resilience monies that can open  new possibilities to implement projects more quickly. Comb through internal budget  sources and consider how to re-purpose existing funds or create new revenue  scenarios to leverage whats already available.  Influence community-wide conversation and day-to-day decisions about long-term  capital improvements to both inform the public and build support for future funding  campaigns. Every community has an investment approach shaped by local values, identified risks,  and consensus solutions resulting from local dialogue. Developing a zero-based local  budget analysis to closely examine resources at hand can be the gateway to advance a  diverse resilience funding strategy. Start by looking at existing internal processes, groups,  or sources of funding as topics for public consideration that could offer unexpected  answers on how to mainstream resilience projects. Local jurisdictions or regional  agencies with cross-functional project groups or inter-departmental work teams may  be able to incorporate resilience components into ongoing capital projects or planning  initiatives.

1333,"Boundary organization investment Another element in the capital strategy is to create a conduit for donations to the local  government for both disaster recovery and pre-disaster mitigation actions. This can be  done within the local government or through formation of a non-profit, 501 (c) 3 organi- zation to serve as a fiscal agent. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs),  regional land trusts, community foundations, and Community Development Corporations  (CDCs) are all potential partners in the initial project phase.  CDFIs, CDCs, land trusts, and community foundations can form a layer of the stack  that bridges local need to grants, revolving loan funds, or private sector investments.  These boundary organization investments can support the pre-development planning,  environmental review, or entitlements that must be in place for projects to be deemed  shovel ready by grant funders, including federal grants. The Santa Barbara Community  Foundation in Southern California supported recovery planning after the 2017/18  disasters struck. Another example is the Rebuild North Bay organization that supports  fire recovery work to restore regional housing after the 2017 Wine Country Fires. Partnering with a boundary organization can help local governments find early funds to  jumpstart projects. Boundary organizations are common for bridging science and policy,  and these organizations can also function to bring diverse partners together for collabo- ration in areas that neither side is an expert in. In the case of disaster resilience, this  partner can provide start-up, pre-development, and entitlement funds for public sector  infrastructure projects and serve as a bridge to implementation from planning to action.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,R2 - EPA 2019 regional_resilience_toolkit_Sept 2020,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1754,Develop Strategies and Actions

1343,"What to Measure and Why? Tracking success and evaluating actions are critical elements in ensuring effective imple- mentation of resilience strategies and projects, meeting local needs, securing sound  investments, and ensuring people work together effectively. Identifying what to measure  (metrics), and how to track and evaluate those metrics over time is central to quantifying  results. Good metrics provide:    A baseline that indicates the starting point;    A target for where the community is going;   An indication if there is something wrong; and    Highlights when the agency or city achieves its goal.  Further, well designed metrics can help tell a story for why resilience building is  necessary, attract political support and funding, and focus efforts while providing a  feedback mechanism about whether decisions, investments, and actions to improve resil- ience are making a difference and can help guide future decisions. Good metrics should  be designed to do the following:    Connect to goals, community values, and desired outcomes.    Feasibly track information required to measure the metric. If the data is too difficult or  expensive to track and gather, it does not help.    Mean something and not simply a count. For example, a metric that indicates a  number of people who receive training does not necessarily correlate to knowledge.   Offer fewer, more meaningful metrics rather than a laundry list that will not be  tracked.   Provide data for accountability, guiding action, telling a story, and measuring success.

However, an output metric does not necessarily demonstrate the quality or success of a  strategy only that something has been done.

Local officials can work with private partners to develop and  finance nature-based solutions in many ways. One key step  is to demonstrate the benefits of nature-based solutions  to  make the business case locally. Another is to offer continued  technical assistance and coordination for nature-based  projects. This may include policy support, training, or other  ways to build capacity. Finally, seek long-term agreements  with any private stakeholders that would provide these  services traditionally delivered by the public sector. Above all,  communities should create partnerships with private parties  for specific projects.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,R3 - fema_bric_nature-based-solutions_2020,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1048,Develop Strategies and Actions
1424,"Rebates and Financing Programs Rebates, tax credits, or low-interest loans can encourage  nature-based solutions and practices. For example, Tucson  Water sponsors a Rainwater Harvesting rebate program. It  provides rebates of up to $2,000 to single-family residential  or small commercial customers who install a rainwater  harvesting system. Eligible options include passive rainwater  harvesting, which directs and retains water in the landscape,  and active rainwater harvesting, such as tanks that store  water for later use. Often, participants in this kind of program  need capital at the beginning of a project. Since residents  may not want or be able to fund improvements on their  own, many communities target their rebates and loans at  businesses. Philadelphia, for example, offers low interest  (1 percent) loans for nature-based solutions retrofits on  non-residential property.  Another finance option for promoting nature-based solutions  is the Department of Energy's Property Assessed Clean  Energy (PACE). Communities can use PACE to help property  owners finance nature-based solutions. It also applies to  installing renewable energy or energy-efficient assets on  private properties. Depending on state laws, communities  can create PACE programs by issuing a revenue bond to the  property owner. PACE borrowers can benefit immediately  from new nature-based solutions and repay their debt by  increasing property taxes. For example, increases are at a  set rate for an agreed-upon term, typically 525 years. The  PACE assessment is attached as a tax on the property, not  the property owner. Because PACE is funded through private  loans or municipal bonds, it creates no liability to local  government funds.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,R3 - fema_bric_nature-based-solutions_2020,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1733,Develop Strategies and Actions
1425,"Grants and Cost-Share Agreements Communities can also encourage nature-based solutions  by directly funding property owners or groups. Onondaga  County, New York has a Green Improvement Fund that  funds nature-based solutions on private commercial and  non-profit properties. Applicants in the target sewer districts  can choose their own nature-based solutions techniques,  but grants are determined by the amount of stormwater  the project captures. The Green Improvement Fund has  awarded 88 grants since 2010, for a total of nearly $11  million. Nature-based solutions projects have included the  installation of porous pavement, added green space, rain  gardens, green roofs, and infiltration projects. Together, the  completed projects can capture more than 38 million gallons  of stormwater runoff per year. Philadelphia manages a similar  voluntary retrofit grant program. It covers the upfront costs  of typical nature-based solutions on private property if the  owner agrees to maintain it.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,R3 - fema_bric_nature-based-solutions_2020,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1000,Develop Strategies and Actions
1427,"Environmental Impact Bonds Several traditional debt financing tools are available to  communities. However, environmental impact bonds (EIBs)  are a recent innovation. EIBs can help communities obtain  upfront capital for hard-to-finance environmental projects.  These bonds link project performance incentives to desired  environmental outcomes. In practice, most EIBs function like  traditional bonds, with a fixed interest rate and term. Unlike  normal bonds, they offer investors a performance payment  if projects perform better than expected. The primary benefit  of this model is that it shifts the project performance risk to  a private party and ties borrowing costs to the effectiveness  of a project. If a project underperforms, investors must  reimburse the borrowing entity; if it overperforms, the entity  pays the investors. This model has potential applications for  multiple areas of environmental restoration and resilience,  including nature-based solutions.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,R3 - fema_bric_nature-based-solutions_2020,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,977,Develop Strategies and Actions
1428,"Development or Redevelopment Incentives Communities can update their land use, zoning, or other  local regulations to provide incentives for using nature-based  solutions. Zoning incentives can allow a greater height,  density, or intensity of development if a developer uses  nature-based approaches. One common zoning incentive  is an increased floor-to-area ratio (FAR), which regulates  the density of development on a site. The City of Portland,  Oregon offers increased FAR as an incentive for installing  green roofs. Communities can also exempt green roofs  or pervious pavements from any regulations that apply to  impervious cover.  More incentives for adopting nature-based solutions  approaches can be used in the development application  and review period. These include discounted application  fees and discounted or waived maintenance bonding  requirements. The City of Chicago, Illinois waives permit fees  for developments that meet specific nature-based solutions  thresholds. For redevelopment, communities can also give a  one-time tax credit for using nature-based approaches that  benefit the public.  More communities are moving from strict standards to  more flexible instruments that include incentives. They are  encouraging developers to use nature-based solutions through  unified development ordinances.

This type of program can offer incentives for  property owners to incorporate nature-based solutions.  For example, a program that charges users based on their  propertys impervious area could offer discounts when  property owners disconnect some of their impervious  area from the storm sewer system by adding nature-based  solutions.

1543,"Once your community has decided to develop or update its hazard mitigation plan, the first task is to determine  the overall scope of the planning project. Task 1 describes how to determine the planning area and the participating  jurisdictions, as well as who will lead the plan and the resources needed to support the planning process. Your  community can develop its own single jurisdiction plan or work with neighboring jurisdictions on a multi- jurisdictional plan.  Establish the Planning Area The planning area refers to the geographic area covered by the plan. Generally, the planning area follows local  government1  jurisdictional boundaries, such as cities, townships, counties, or planning districts. However, planning  areas also may be defined by watersheds or other natural features, particularly where hazards create similar risks  across jurisdictional boundaries. A jurisdictions boundaries may also cross over or encompass other jurisdictions,  such as a fire protection district or a utility district.  The State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO)2  or State emergency management agency can help communities  determine the appropriate planning area. This determination may be based on State planning goals and planning  grant funding priorities.  Mitigation Plan Updates  If you are updating your communitys plan, determine if the planning area defined in the previously approved  plan is still appropriate. Review any lessons learned in the previous planning process.

Although not required, some communities choose to develop  objectives to help define or organize mitigation actions (see  Figure 6.2). Objectives are broader than specific actions, but  are measurable, unlike goals.

Mitigation activities lessen or eliminate the need for preparedness or response resources in the  future. When analyzing risks and identifying mitigation actions, the planning team may also identify emergency  response or operational preparedness actions. Examples include:  Creating mutual aid agreements with neighboring communities to meet emergency response needs.  Purchasing radio communications equipment for the Fire Department.  Developing procedures for notifying citizens of available shelter locations during and following an event. For some hazards, such as tornados, including preparedness actions in the mitigation plan may be necessary  and practical. The mitigation plan may be the best place for your community to capture and justify the need for  these actions.

1630,"Identifying Mitigation Actions The mitigation planning regulation requires that each participating  jurisdiction identify and analyze a comprehensive range of specific  mitigation actions and projects to reduce the impacts of the hazards  identified in the risk assessment. The emphasis is on the impacts or  vulnerabilities identified in the risk assessment, not on the hazards  themselves. As described in Task 5, these impacts and vulnerabilities  may be summarized in problem statements. Some hazards may not  have many impacts, or the impacts may already be mitigated. In this  case, fewer mitigation actions may be identified than for a hazard  causing more frequent or severe impacts.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),NA,R5 - fema_local_mitigation_handbook,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,691,Develop Strategies and Actions
1632,Structure and  Infrastructure  Projects These actions involve modifying existing  structures and infrastructure to protect them  from a hazard or remove them from a hazard  area. This could apply to public or private  structures as well as critical facilities and  infrastructure.  This type of action also involves projects to  construct manmade structures to reduce the  impact of hazards. Many of these types of actions are projects  eligible for funding through the FEMA Hazard  Mitigation Assistance program.

These actions may also include participation  in national programs, such as StormReady1 or Firewise2 Communities. Although this  type of mitigation reduces risk less directly  than structural projects or regulation, it is an  important foundation. A greater understanding  and awareness of hazards and risk among local  officials, stakeholders, and the public is more  likely to lead to direct actions.  Radio or television spots  Websites with maps and information  Real estate disclosure  Presentations to school groups or neighborhood organizations  Mailings to residents in hazard-prone areas.

1635,"A comprehensive range means that communities analyze, or evaluate, different types of mitigation actions. For  example, building retrofits, infrastructure protection, and changes in local ordinances represent a mix of structural  and non-structural approaches. In addition, each jurisdiction must consider actions that reduce risk to existing  buildings and infrastructure, as well as limit risk to new development and redevelopment.  The planning team may identify low-cost mitigation actions that can be readily implemented, such as developing  an outreach program to encourage homeowners to secure furnishings and utilities to prevent injuries and damage  during an earthquake. Other actions may depend on available funding, such as retrofitting critical infrastructure.  Though funding and support may not be immediately available for every action, including the actions in the plan  may lead to future opportunities for implementation. For example, some actions can be implemented following a  disaster when additional funding and political and public support are available, such as acquiring homes in a flood  hazard area. Additionally, if actions are not included in the plan, securing funding may be more difficult once it  becomes available. To identify potential mitigation actions, the planning team needs to review the risk assessment and assess  capabilities.  1. Review Risk Assessment The planning team should start with the problem statements developed from the risk assessment. For each problem  statement, consider different types of mitigation actions for addressing the problem. See the example on the page  6-6.  You may have multiple ideas that are categorized under one type (e.g., education and awareness or local plans and  regulations) and no ideas under another type. However, the intent is to think comprehensively when identifying  potential actions and to consider future development.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,R5 - fema_local_mitigation_handbook,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1914,Develop Strategies and Actions
1636,". Assess Capabilities The mitigation strategy is based on existing local authorities, policies, programs, and resources, as well as the ability  to expand on and improve these existing tools. As part of Task 4, the planning team reviewed existing capabilities for  reducing long-term vulnerability to hazards. Those capabilities can be assessed to identify gaps to be addressed and  strengths to enhance through new mitigation actions. For instance, can gaps in design or enforcement of existing  regulations be addressed through additional personnel or a change in procedure or policy? Could an existing  education program be improved to cover the most significant hazards and better target non-English speakers? Are  additional studies, reports, or plans needed to understand risk?  Jurisdictions participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can consider actions to enhance their  floodplain management program, such as addressing repetitive loss properties and improving standards beyond the  minimum requirements for NFIP participation.  Communities also must consider actions that reduce risk to future development. The planning team can evaluate  the effects of current growth plans and regulations (i.e., comprehensive plans, zoning and subdivisions ordinances,  building codes, and capital improvement programs) on community safety and consider how these could be updated  to reduce the communitys vulnerability. For instance, development review procedures may be revised to include a  hazard assessment for new development. The types of questions that the community can ask include:  Will population growth and future land use plans put more people in hazardous areas?  Will current redevelopment policies increase the population and property vulnerable to hazards?  Will planned infrastructure extensions encourage unsafe development by facilitating access to hazardous areas?",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,R5 - fema_local_mitigation_handbook,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1902,Develop Strategies and Actions

For instance, the risk assessment can form the basis for other emergency management program  activities, including the emergency operations and evacuation planning. Incorporation of hazard information and  mapping into land use plans, zoning and subdivision codes, and the development review process can guide growth  and redevelopment away from high-risk locations.

For instance, a Community Wildfire  Protection Plan3  identifies a communitys priorities for wildfire fuel reduction projects. A capital improvements  program outlines a jurisdictions spending plan for capital projects that support existing and future developments,  such as roads, water, and sewer systems, usually over a 5-year period. Mitigation projects that could be included in  the capital improvements plan include strengthening at-risk critical facilities or acquiring open space in identified  hazard areas.

The capability assessment developed in Task 4  can be helpful in determining the agencies responsible for certain  functions in the community and the available financial resources. Assign Responsible Agency The planning team needs to determine which department or  agency is most appropriate to lead each action. In order to clearly  describe how actions will be implemented and administered,  at a minimum, a specific agency, department, or position must  be assigned to the action, not the jurisdiction as a whole. If  coordinating with other agencies will be necessary, this is a good  time for them to provide input on the steps and timeframes  necessary to carry out the actions.",IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING,Implementation,NA,R5 - fema_local_mitigation_handbook,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1002,Implement the Action Plan

To continue to be an effective  representation of the jurisdictions overall strategy for reducing risk to natural hazards, the updated  local mitigation plan must reflect current conditions and progress in mitigation efforts. The 5-year plan  update is an opportunity for each jurisdiction to assess its previous goals and actions, evaluate progress in  implementing the action plan, and adjust its actions to address current realities. The mitigation strategy should also  be revised following disasters to determine if the recommended actions are still appropriate given the impacts of the  event.  Evaluate Progress in Implementation Plan updates must reflect progress in local mitigation efforts.  Whereas goals may not change significantly over a 5-year  timeframe, the integration of the plan into existing planning  mechanisms and the implementation of mitigation actions  demonstrate progress in risk reduction.",IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING,Evaluation and Monitoring,NA,R5 - fema_local_mitigation_handbook,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1146,Monitor and Evaluate Progress
1646,"Completion of Mitigation Actions The plan also must describe the status of the mitigation actions identified in the previous plan by describing those  that have been completed or not completed. For actions that have not been completed, the plan must either describe  whether the action is no longer relevant or indicate whether it is included as part of the updated action plan.  The planning team may ask the local agencies and departments assigned responsibility for the implementation of  mitigation actions in the previous plan to provide a status update on each of their actions. For instance, agencies  could provide an evaluation of the following:   If the action was completed, did it have the intended results? Did it achieve the goals outlined in the plan? What  factors contributed to success?  If the action was not completed, what were the barriers to implementation? For instance, was there a lack of  political support, funding, staff availability, or other obstacle? Should the action be included in the updated  mitigation strategy?

Your communitys mitigation  priorities may change over time for a variety of reasons. Addressing  changes in priorities allows you to redirect actions to reflect  current conditions, including financial and political realities,  or changes in conditions or priorities due to disaster events. In  addition, now that the community has implemented some actions,  you may apply lessons learned about what works and does not.  New actions can be identified based on the updated risk assessment and capability assessment. New actions are  prioritized in combination with the actions carried forward from the previous plan. Factors that may influence  changes in priorities include the following:  Altered conditions due to disaster events and recovery priorities  Changing local resources, community needs, and capabilities  New State or Federal policies and funding resources  New hazard impacts identified in the updated risk assessment  Changes in development patterns that could influence the effects of hazards  New partners that have come to the table If no changes in priorities are necessary, plan updates may validate the information in the previously approved plan.",IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING,Evaluation and Monitoring,NA,R5 - fema_local_mitigation_handbook,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1298,Monitor and Evaluate Progress

For example, the plan may describe a monitoring system for tracking the  status of the identified mitigation actions and reporting this information on a quarterly basis. The responsible agency  assigned to each mitigation action may be responsible for tracking and reporting on each of their actions. Appendix  A includes an example worksheet for reporting progress on a mitigation action (see Worksheet 7.1).  The planning team must identify the lead position or agency, usually the same individual or agency leading the  plans development, for coordinating the monitoring process.

The planning team must identify how, when, and by  whom the plan will be updated. Documenting the procedures for updating the plan requires an explanation of who  will be responsible for updating the plan and when and how this process will be initiated. The plan must include  the title of the individual or name of the department or agency responsible for leading the updating effort. It may  be appropriate to include a schedule of activities that allows sufficient time to obtain funding for and complete the  planning process before the plan expires.  The planning team can also establish procedures for updating the plan following a disaster event or concurrent with  the development of a recovery or post-disaster redevelopment plan. Your communitys vulnerabilities and mitigation  priorities often change following a disaster, and additional funding sources may become available, such as FEMAs  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or Public Assistance. Generally, public awareness increases, and the demand and  support for mitigation frequently increases following a disaster. You may choose to take advantage of opportunities  to incorporate mitigation into recovery strategies and to rebuild wisely and safely to avoid similar losses in the  future.

The key activities are intended to serve as additional  considerations that expand on the overarching six planning steps, as illustrated in the graphic below, and  focus more specifically on the challenges and unique partnerships necessary for successful pre-disaster  recovery planning. In the following chapters this guide provides guidance for applying these steps and  activities in a scalable fashion in large to small communities. The planning process introduced and discussed in this guide directly aligns with the process outlined in  Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans: Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG 101).

1705,"The planning process should incorporate the results of other applicable planning processes in the  community and region. Hazard mitigation plans, comprehensive plans, housing plans, and other  planning documents can define a wide range of goals for the community and represent shared priorities  of community members. Linking recovery planning to build on the communitys existing plans helps  inform recovery planning efforts and capitalize on past planning efforts so as not to reinvent the wheel.  Additionally, linking recovery planning with other applicable planning processes helps to incorporate  community perspectives. Recovery activities can then in turn be used to inform revisions to the  communitys other plans. Including the whole community in the pre-disaster recovery planning process  means including all sectors of the community. Many existing Federal programs relate to disaster recovery. While many of these programs are voluntary for  communities, the requirements for participation could benefit communities when they develop their pre- disaster recovery plan. For example, the Economic Development Administration requires communities to  produce Community Economic Development Strategies, and the Department of Health and Human Services  has preparedness requirements for communities that relate to disaster recovery. A pre-disaster recovery  planning process would build upon these existing efforts.  Figure 2 outlines the relationship between existing plans, like those mentioned above, and the pre-disaster  recovery plan.

Equally important is the development  of realistic goals. Although a community may have its own resources or partner resources at its disposal,  the resources available to recover effectively are finite. Goal development in both the pre-disaster and  post-disaster environments needs to account for the availability of resources so that they may be leveraged  strategically to achieve desired outcomes.

Mitigation is a sustained action eliminating or reducing  potential effects of hazards, and mitigation planning attempts to identify those hazards, reduce any impacts  from those hazards, and identify potential solutions. Thus mitigation planning, pre-disaster recovery  planning, and other types of planning have parallel perspectives with overarching recovery goals of:  Increasing the speed of community recovery;  Effectively using resources; and  Increasing opportunities for community betterment that take into account and balance all community populations, needs, and risks. A successful mitigation program and other pre-disaster planning can set the stage for a more sustainable  and resilient community by positioning the community to be able to adapt to changing conditions, identify  future natural and human-related disaster threats and hazards, and withstand and rapidly recover from  disruption due to future emergencies. By addressing potential risks and developing solutions, policies, and  action statements, communities become both more resilient and sustainable.",GUIDE PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES,Term definition,NA,R7 - PreDisasterRecoveryGuideforLocalGov2017,Resilience and Hazard Mitigation,1363,Set Goals and Objectives

This evaluation  of recovery capacity can be framed around the eight  Core Capabilities that apply to the Recovery Mission  Area, as well as the Mitigation Core Capabilities  that address integration of community resilience.  Suggested questions for community self-assessment,  framed around the cross-cutting Recovery Core  Capabilities, are included in Table 3. Completing  this evaluation and comparing identified needs  to established roles and existing community  resources allows the community to identify gaps.

The planning team  should determine specified times for recovery of functions or  services provided by building clusters and/or infrastructure  systems, with input from owners, operators, and other key  stakeholders. Long-term community goals should inform specific community resilience goals.  The desired performance goals are expressed as recovery times and should  build on the social and economic characteristics and needs of the community  from Step 2. For example:  The desired performance for critical facilities, such as emergency rooms and 911 call centers, is typically  continuous service or minimal disruption after a hazard event.   Most residents should be able to shelter in their homes or in emergency housing after a hazard event, and  utility services should be restored in a maximum of one or two weeks to keep residents in the community.   Small businesses and major employers need to resume within one-to-two weeks to maintain the economy;  schools and daycare need to have similar goals for resuming operations so all parents can work.   In contrast, it may be reasonable to set recovery times for non-emergency city services at weeks or months,  such as parks and recreation facilities. The desired recovery time between a hazard event and the recovery of community functions and services is  independent of the type of hazard. For instance, the desired recovery time for a hospital or utility will be the same for a  range of hazards (e.g., flood, hurricane, earthquake).

For drainage and wastewater infrastructure planning in a changing  climate, the sewer network and wastewater infrastructure should be qualitatively evaluated, from the upstream  pipes to the regulator chambers, pump stations, interceptors, and ultimately to the downstream outfall, to  determine the feasibility of incorporating climate change projections into the system design. For DEP storm  sewer projects in FY 2021 or later in separately sewered drainage areas where the design is in the early  stages and there is free discharge, the agency is evaluating the feasibility of revising the design to incorporate  climate projections into the design.

Successful long-term planning also depends on  having a clear picture of a long-term mission and vision that includes aspects  of your coalitions structure or policy strategies that should be maintained or  improved (Lasker & Weiss, 2003). Consider expanding your definition around  sustainability to include the efforts of like-minded partners and organiza- tions; it may be work that they are already doing. However coalition members  decide to proceed, consider the following suggestions:   Determine what type of organization will best suit the needs of the  coalition for the long run (For more information see Module 3. Estab- lishing a Home for Healthy Communities Work on page 71). Organize  your coalition structure and communication strategies to help achieve  your objectives.

For coalitions just beginning their plan, ask members, external stakeholders, local groups, and com- munity members to fill out a connection mapa catalog of existing and potential community connections.  (See the HCC example on page 21). When looking for support and resources (e.g., funding, in-kind support,  people) to help achieve and sustain organizational or policy goals, consider using all or some of the assets and  connections available. Then review the maps with appropriate individuals to find any potential sustainability  connections; they may be willing to make the initial contact for you. (Be sure you get prior approval to use  any newly established connections). If youre not sure what a new organization can bring to the table, find the  right people from that organization and interview them to determine their interests and potential resources.

Continue until you have discussed each item. Then return to set-aside items and decide whether to continue  each. Proceed until everyone agrees on all efforts. You may modify items that you decide to continue, but  discuss later. Review decisions to ensure that the group is comfortable. If people hesitate, you may need more  discussion. You may have missed key criteria, or some that you selected were over- or undervalued. If so,  return to Step 5; revise your criteria grid by changing the criteria or scale.

2155,"What about Strategies That Are Not Continued? Most likely, some strategies and activities will discontinued for several possible reasons. Some will have been  completed and wont need to be repeated anytime soon (e.g., policy forum). Other activities might still be in  their beginning stages, not having reached their stated strategy goals. Ending or de-prioritizing an activity can  be difficult, especially if people are passionate about it. (Having a skilled, neutral facilitator can be helpful in  this situation). Remember that ending a particular effort is not necessarily a bad thing, because resources can  now be leveraged in a way that is more likely to meet community needs. Relish any small successes that came  from the effort and note what has been learned from it. This will help guide future coalition efforts.  Whatever the reason for de-prioritizing a strategy, the coalition should take steps to formally close it out (e.g.,  completing an evaluation and final report). This way, there will be a record of relevant decisions and actions in  case the strategy is revisited by other organizations seeking to do similar work.

Maybe its not feasible for your coalition to sustain so many strategies and activities  at once, or some dont precisely fit your criteria for continuation (see Step 5). Spinning off strategies to other organizations that will support them in the long run is a solid sustainability  goal (Goodman & Steckler, 1989).

Consider whether or not your current fiscal agent is able to manage funds from a variety of sources.   Request that coalition members add collaborative support costs into their funding proposals.    Use fees to continue community improvements (DeJong & Davidson, 2000). For example, fees charged to  rent local park facilities can fund continuing after-school recreation activities.    Leverage existing funding sources with other local efforts. For example, ask school districts or city and  county governments to financially support efforts that fall within their own programs. Also, consider  partnering with the local parks and recreation department to monitor trail usage on a quarterly basis by  sharing positions and resources.

The evaluation experience is likely to be more positive and its results more useful if you  build evaluation in from the start and make it an on-going activity. This includes planning a summary evalua- tion before an intervention begins, which helps to clarify program goals and reasonable outcomes. At this stage, evaluation will help you improve your PSE efforts and implementation. It is important to peri- odically assess and adapt your organizational structure and activities for achieving your policy objectives to  ensure they are as effective as possible. Evaluation can help you identify areas for improvement and ultimately  help you realize your goals more efficiently (Hornik, 2002; Noar, 2006). It will also allow you to demonstrate  coalition success or progress. Does your coalitions current infrastructure and planning processes enable it to  effectively and efficiently achieve its goals? The information you collect allows you to better communicate  your coalitions impact to others, which is critical for public relations, staff morale, and attracting and retaining  support from current and potential funders (Hornik & Yanovitzky, 2003).",IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING,Evaluation and Monitoring,NA,S2 - CDC_sustainability_guide,Sustainability,1331,Monitor and Evaluate Progress
2175,"Why are policies important for sustainability? Policies can serve the concept of sustainability by providing long-term goals around which community  members can rally. A coalition should not only promote policies but also ensure that theyve been imple- mented as expected and are having the intended effect. Sustainability is, in large part, about developing momentum to maintain community-wide changes that  improve public health. Policy strategies are the most effective way to ensure long-term momentum. While individual approaches to behavior change are important for health promotion efforts, these changes  need to be prompted and supported by changes in environments, social norms, and networks that support  positive health decisions (Green, Richard, & Potvin, 1996; Stokols, 1996). Whether implemented in schools,  the community, or within community organizations, policy strategies can result in change on multiple lev- els, significantly impacting social and cultural norms and values (Swinburn, 2008; Stunkard & Pennick, 1979).  To achieve sustainability, a policy strategy needs to impact everyone in its priority population (Brownson,  2009). Policy strategies are a population-wide approach and can impact far more people than individual  strategies. Policies can also be replicated in multiple community settings and on many levels.  In addition, policy strategies are more economically sustainable long-term than other approaches (Swinburn,  2008). Once a policy has been implemented, few, if any, resources are usually needed to sustain resulting  community improvements. In fact, policy strategies can yield continuous improvements even if the institu- tions or coalitions that helped enact them are not themselves sustained (Holder & Moore, 2000, p. 75). For  these reasons, a policy approach is the best way to work toward sustainable change in the community.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Regulatory policy and legislation,S2 - CDC_sustainability_guide,Sustainability,1880,Develop Strategies and Actions
2177,"Why is a home for Healthy Communities work important for sustainability? To ensure long-term success, a collaborative Healthy Communities initiative needs to adjust to potential  changese.g., in funding, local opportunities or alliances, public health needs, and community and coali- tion leadership priorities. A critical step in meeting this challenge is to consider where and how to organize  a base of operationsalso known as a community homeso that the initiative can flourish during and  after transformation (this includes thinking about the role of the fiscal agent). This community home should  be able to: serve as an objective broker of public health resources; solicit and administer a variety of funding  sources; appeal to a variety of community-based organizations; establish an internal infrastructure; and shift  priorities to accommodate changes in goals and community needs. As long as these criteria are met, a community home could be located in a government branch, a communi- ty health 501(c)3 organization, or an existing not-for-profit or for-profit venture (e.g., hospital or foundation).  Or it may be best to develop a new 501(c)3. Each option has its strengths and weaknesses. Also, what works  in one community may not work in another.

Helping them do so not only benefits the coalition as a whole, it also helps motivate members to  sustain their participation. Coalition training and skill buildingreferred to collectively here as trainingare geared toward admin- istrative, process, or public-health content. Administrative training topics can include fund-raising, proj- ect planning, budgeting, and structuring coalitions for success. Process training can include such items  as team building, leadership training, communication, and project planning. Public health content can  include current strategies to promote specific efforts around chronic disease risk factors (e.g., tobacco use,  prevention, and control), physical activity and nutrition, understanding health equity, and elements of the  built environment. Coalition members can learn skills from self-help methods (e.g., e-learning) or through  face-to-face workshops that can help with strategic or program planning and process training.  Coalitions can use a variety of assessment processes to determine the best type of training, including sur- veys, coalition-wide discussions, consultation with coalition coordinators or technical assistance (TA) staff,  and a review of the literature on best practices.  The last two options are particularly important, because they provide an outside, objective perspective. TA  staff members often come from funding organizations. They may have had high-level training and be in a  position to offer detached insight into coalition training needs.

By using various media to convey policy messages, coalitions are able to develop public/decision-maker  awareness and support around policy strategies, in addition to keeping them informed about the overall  Healthy Communities effort.

Social marketing provides an action framework for generating discussion and promoting information, at- titudes, and values that are conducive to long-term behavioral changes in certain populations. Influencing  behavior in individuals can contribute to policy changes within a community-at-large. When beginning  your coalitions social marketing plan, remember to keep the audiences perspective in mind and consider all  potential barriers to behavior change.  For your coalitions social marketing efforts to be successful, you need to know what can motivate a cer- tain population to adopt a desired behavior. When making the choice to change, a person has to make an  exchange, or give one thing up in return for something else. This exchange can be concrete (money) or less  tangible (e.g., improvement in health, social acceptance, or safety).

Many water infrastructure decisions share interdependencies with housing, transportation,  and other infrastructure, requiring collaboration or pursuit of coordinated strategies to optimize these  investments. A system-wide approach involves utilities looking beyond the fence line to include  community institutions, and the implementation of projects outside the utilitys direct span of control.

2198,"Element Description  Utilities should consider and set sustainability goals to provide a foundation for incorporating  sustainability considerations throughout the planning process. These goals should reflect internal  assessment of sustainability priorities as well as community sustainability priorities identified through  information gathering and consultation with local institutions and stakeholders. Utilities are also  encouraged to engage other municipal departments, as appropriate. For example, there may not be  enough biosolids generated by the utility to cost-effectively operate a digester, but in combination with  organics collected by the solid waste department, there may be enough energy generated to justify a  major equipment purchase.  Ideally, utility consultation with communities  and customers about sustainability goals occurs as part of ongoing engagement about  services, key decisions, and revenue needs.  Information gathering about community  sustainability priorities, however, can take  many forms, from review of existing  community plans or other documents to  direct consultation with community  representatives (e.g., planning agencies,  elected officials, and stakeholder groups).  Sustainability goals are critical for guiding  utilities as they move through the other three  elements to set measurable objectives and  strategies, analyze alternatives, and develop a  financial strategy to support chosen  investments.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1459,Set Goals and Objectives

2206,"Step 1. Identify sustainability priorities and potential opportunities for the utility Utilities first consider their own sustainability priorities by internally assessing infrastructure and  operations that may provide opportunities for increased sustainability and improved performance. For  example, utilities may want to assess operations using the Effective Utility Management Primer  described in the Introduction to this handbook. Similarly, many aspects of a utilitys asset management  plan can provide useful information for identifying sustainability opportunities. A vulnerability  assessment can pinpoint opportunities for improved system resilience. It can also identify gaps in  technical, managerial, and financial capacity that, when address, can help utilities achieve sustainability  goals. For many utilities, sustainability priorities may focus almost exclusively on strategies for meeting  regulatory requirements or approaches for sustaining existing infrastructure and operations as opposed  to new projects.  Although Step 1 is internally focused, it can be informed by ongoing customer and community  relationships and their expectations about the role and operation of the utility. It can also be informed  by the range of incentives utilities have to become more sustainable, including cost savings, financial  benefits, and alignment with the utilities traditional mission or sustainability policies.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1428,Set Goals and Objectives

Utilities can utilize planning documents or  ongoing planning efforts to gather relevant  community sustainability priority information, such as transportation plans,  climate action plans, watershed plans, or  community vision documents. As part of considering these plans, utilities  should develop familiarity with the  community-wide priorities these plans  seek to address. Furthermore, utilities  should improve understanding of the institutions (and key contact personnel)  responsible for planning, and  opportunities for involvement in ongoing  planning processes (e.g., as part of  steering committees, or through direct  agency-to-agency dialogue).",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,829,Set Goals and Objectives

Identify and document sustainability goals Regardless of the up-front consultation approach, the utility should document and make available a  description of its process and identify the sustainability goals that emerged from the consultation.  These goals will guide development of the remaining elements, including decisions about infrastructure  investments and other potential utility operational changes. Documentation can also help communicate  sustainability goals to boards, other oversight bodies, and utility employees.

2213,"Step 1. Identify sustainability objectives  Utilities should identify an objective or objectives for each sustainability goal. Any vulnerabilities in  technical, managerial, or financial capacity of the utility that would preclude achieving sustainability  goals should be targeted for specific objectives and strategies. Measuring performance relative to  vulnerabilities is critical to achieving a sustainable course of action.  In some cases, utilities may want to  express sustainability objectives in  terms of specific quantitative  targets. For example, a utility may  want to reduce energy  consumption by 10 percent or  increase water efficiency by 25  percent. In other cases, a utility may want to develop procedural  objectives, such as developing  policies that target infrastructure  investments to existing  communities. Utilities may also  want to establish a procedural  objective to create a level playing  field among optionsincluding  those that are more sustainable.  For example, a utility could set an  objective to evaluate non- traditional project alternatives  (e.g., decentralized wastewater  solutions, green infrastructure for  stormwater, etc.) along with  conventional grey infrastructure  or to evaluate partnership  opportunities in any analysis of  system expansion options.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1308,Set Goals and Objectives
2214,"Step 2. Ensure that objectives are SMART The most effective objectives are SMART:  Specific: Utilities specify exactly what they want to achieve  Measurable: Utilities are able to measure whether they are meeting the objectives  Attainable: Utilities can realistically achieve the objective in the time period specified  Realistic: Utilities can achieve the objective with the capacity, funding, and other resources available  Time-based: Utilities set a timeframe for achieving the objective An example of a SMART objective, which was developed by the City of Portland Water Bureau, is: Reduce the bureaus overall electrical use by 5 percent (excluding variation due to weather and  groundwater operation) by July 2012, compared to a 2005-08 baseline. While these objectives clearly establish a target, other types of objectives can be similarly SMART. For  example, a utility could establish an objective to evaluate green infrastructure alternatives for any  proposed infrastructure investment of over $10 million and revisit the investment threshold in five  years. Utilities should strive to set objectives that are achievable and realistic. They may, however, be  operating in an environment where information on their baseline and realistic objectives is lacking. In  this case, utilities may want to set provisional objectives that can be refined later. As part of a continual  improvement process, these objectives may be refined and adapted over time as more information is  gathered and project alternatives are evaluated and selected. For example, a utility may identify current  energy consumption and the relative costs and benefits of energy efficiency alternatives before setting a  specific target. Utilities with low hanging fruit may set an ambitious objective, while utilities with few  remaining low-cost efficiency options may set a more conservative target.",COMMUNITY GOAL SETTING AND COORDINATION,Community Goals Identification,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1880,Set Goals and Objectives

Identify key strategies Baseline analysis can help utilities identify  general strategies for achieving sustainability  objectives and for conducting in-depth  alternatives analysis (described later in this  handbook). In addition to considering  strategies that would involve new  infrastructure, utilities can consider, where  appropriate, collaboration and partnering  relationships as a way to meet objectives. In  many cases, it may be useful to undertake a  basic brainstorming approach. As utilities begin this step, they should keep in  mind basic tips about brainstorming:  Dont judge, challenge, evaluate, or  criticize suggested strategies;   Emphasize the quantity of ideas, not  quality; and  Put analysis and organization in the background.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,762,Develop Strategies and Actions
2218,"Element Description  Effectively integrating sustainability goals and objectives into an analysis of infrastructure alternatives is  a critical component of planning. It allows utilities and local officials to make infrastructure decisions  consistent with sustainability goals and objectives best suited for the utility and the community. Alternatives analysis can be conducted at many  scales, from an analysis of system-wide  infrastructure alternatives to specific engineering  decisions about the repair, rehabilitation, or  replacement of specific equipment. The steps  and examples described below focus on project- level alternatives analysis linked to utility goals  and objectives but can be translated to different  scales. For alternatives analysis to be effective, utilities  need to establish explicit and consistent project  selection criteria for each sustainability objective.  Identifying and applying sustainability criteria is  the critical juncture at which utilities choose the  specific economic, environmental, and social  benefits they will weigh in selecting among  alternatives. A replicable, consistent, and  transparent approach will ensure that each  alternative is considered on a level playing field.  When done well, this approach will enable utilities to choose a mix of projects that meets  customers service expectations, optimizes the  sustainability of utility infrastructure and  operations, and supports other community  sustainability priorities whenever feasible. The  selected alternatives will thus represent best  value projects for the utility and for the  community as a whole.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Selection,NA,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1624,Develop Strategies and Actions

Alternatives often involve the repair, rehabilitation,  or replacement of aging infrastructure or investment in new infrastructure to meet demand growth or regulatory requirements, including those driven by enforcement actions. As typically practiced,  alternatives analysis considers criteria such as technical performance, cost, maintainability, and  reliability. These criteria screen for alternatives that deliver the highest reliable performance at the  lowest overall cost.

Many project alternatives will come from the general  Evaluating Green Infrastructure Alternatives  As part of alternatives analysis, utilities should assess what types  of non-traditional or green infrastructure alternatives may help  achieve objectives. Lack of familiarity or experience with these  alternatives, however, can create challenges. In particular,  utilities may face uncertain operations and maintenance costs for  green infrastructure alternatives. In response, utilities can phase in green infrastructure  investments and then consider further deployment based on  what they learn about effectiveness and cost. In alternatives  analysis, utilities may want to examine a range of deployment  optionsfrom pilot scale to maximum technically achievable and identify the right level of deployment given their needs and  the level of knowledge or uncertainty about green infrastructure.Planning for Sustainability Page 35 strategies identified in Element 2.

Setting and applying project selection  criteria is the critical juncture at which  utilities choose the economic,  environmental, and social benefits they  will weigh in selecting among  alternatives and choosing the mix of  projects that optimizes the sustainability  of utility operations.  Community stakeholder views are also  important when evaluating alternatives.  Where feasible, utilities should consider  using community input to identify  project selection criteria and their  relative importance. For example,  Louisville and Jefferson County  Metropolitan Sewer District in Kentucky convened community stakeholders to  identify community values for analyzing and selecting among options for  reducing wet weather flows.

Different types of  analysis may be appropriate for different plans or for utilities with different levels of capacity. Options  include:  A narrative, qualitative assessment of potential benefits and risks of each alternative (may be  most appropriate for utilities with limited resources or capacity).

In this  example, the utility distributes ten points among the three criteria. Riparian area protection and odor  control are considered equally importantand more important than construction-related disruptions.

2237,"Step 2: Account fully for operations and  maintenance costs The selected project alternatives will likely  change overall operations and maintenance  costs for the utility (either up or down).  Although these costs should have been fully  profiled during alternatives analysis, it is  important to thoroughly review the estimates  at this point in the process. This will ensure  revenue requirement estimates are fully  reflective of any changes in O&M costs  resulting from the new project(s). From a project financial sustainability point of  view, asset depreciation is an additional  operating cost area to consider. Establishing a  project depreciation expense, an area of  potential weakness in many revenue adequacy determinations, is critical to estimating revenue  requirements sufficient to replace aging infrastructure. Revenue requirements reflecting depreciation  costs can provide the means to establish and fund repair and replacement accounts. Underfunding predictive and preventive maintenance (i.e., failing to fully estimate costs as part of the  revenue requirements determination) is a key vulnerability of revenue adequacy determinations.  Ongoing condition assessment costs of any new infrastructure also need to be accounted for, consistent  with the utilitys asset management program requirements. Overall, maintenance costs will be unique  to the particular assets involved, but should be driven by the utilitys asset management program, which  will set the type and frequency of desired maintenance. Because underfunding predictive and  preventive maintenance is a common problem, thorough consideration of project maintenance costs  with the underpinning of the utilitys asset management program is critical to ensuring maintenance  needs are fully represented when establishing funding adequacy. A 2002 GAO report estimated that 29  percent of water utilities deferred maintenance due to inadequate funding.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1936,Develop Strategies and Actions

To ensure revenue requirements  associated with the new projects are  correctly established, the following  potential impacts should be examined:   Changes in the cost of service to  different classes of customers;   Changes in the utilization and  expense of existing  infrastructure by the addition of  new infrastructure (e.g., bigger  new pipes that bring larger  volume flows to an existing treatment facility);   Changes in the type and utilization rates of personnel;   Changes in the need to provide emergency services; and   Changes in the resiliency of existing infrastructure and facilities (with potential implications for  emergency preparedness and insurance costs).",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,945,Develop Strategies and Actions
2239,"As indicated above, new project(s) may also affect revenues available to the utility. The utility should  therefore examine if the project(s) will affect any of the assumptions used in its revenue projections.  Key areas for consideration are any change to the size of the customer base or to customer utilization  rates. For example, conservation pricing has the potential to decrease utilization rates as customers  conserve water, which may reduce revenues and potentially make them less predictable.17 Step 4: Develop a capital financing strategy Similarly, an  economic downturn can reduce the number of utility customers or their ability to pay. This decreased  rate-paying base can place substantial financial pressure on the utility. An effective capital financing strategy is critical  to the financial sustainability of the selected  project alternatives and the utility system as a  whole. A utility should seek a capital financing  strategy that keeps capital acquisition and  interest costs as low as possible and keeps the  repayment schedule (principal and interest)  consistent with revenue capacity (cash flow).  The mix of financing options used by the utility  and how debt is structured will affect financial  sustainability. There are two basic building  blocks of an effective capital financing strategy:  1) identifying and comparing the full range of  project financing options available, and 2)  managing capital commitments and debt  structure on an ongoing basis consistent with  utility revenue capacity and borrowing conditions.",STRATEGY IDENTIFICATION,Strategy Action (general),Financing and Funding,S3 - planning-for-sustainability-water-and-wastewater,Sustainability,1557,Develop Strategies and Actions

Four basic options exist for capitalization of proposed project(s): rates and other  utility direct revenue sources, federal or state loan or subsidy programs, revenue bonds, and state  grants. The mix of capitalization approaches used can substantially affect borrowing costs and  repayment schedules. In general, utilities have two choices when funding new capital investmentsusing revenues to pay as  you go for new investments, or using long-term debt financing. Under a pay as you go approach,  capitalization through utility rates and other revenues does not carry debt financing costs, but it is  typically reserved for routine replacement of existing facilities, system extensions, and basic  improvements that can fit comfortably into annual utility revenue capacity.

2245,"Structuring Capital Commitments and Debt Debt structure is the second critical aspect of a financing strategy. It is linked to prevailing borrowing  conditions and the phasing of capital project implementation. A utility, when structuring debt, should  consider prevailing and anticipated future bond market conditions (to the extent that revenue bonds are  an important element of the capital financing approach). Key variables a utility can manage, depending  on conditions, are the timing of borrowing, the amount of each increment of borrowing, and the mix of  interest and principal paid on an annual basis over the life of the repayment schedule. Maintaining  ongoing awareness of bond market conditions can provide refinancing opportunities throughout the life  of the project, particularly in cases where a utility has strategically deferred principal payments as a  result of financing during an unfavorable interest rate climate. Regardless of the public or private  financing option(s) selected, a utility can adjust project phasing, and therefore the associated annual  capital principal and interest cost requirements.

How does one quantify the value of clean air, open space, a pristine shoreline, quality of life, or, for that matter, human lives, especially those of future generations? One broad rule of thumb is that it is usually best to start with the most pressing problems and those that lend themselves to the most direct and cost-effective solutions. Then use a systematic planning approach such as an environmental management system (EMS), described in the next sec- tion of this handbook, to continue to im- prove performance over time. It is also important to consider the full cost and full benefits of each approach to determine an accurate payback period. For example, preventing sewer overflows into rivers and seas can improve drink- ing water, aquatic-based commerce and tourism. Electricity and fuel-saving pro- grams can reduce operating costs, and re- cycling materials, like aluminum and cop- per, can be lucrative. The payback periods may be shorter than you think.

Each section of this guide provides met- rics to emphasize that careful tracking is essential to the success of any program. Metrics and goals should not only be es- tablished for each element of your plan, but taking a holistic approach is recom- mended to link all governmental activities to the goal of sustainability. Once some overarching goals have been set, a series of measurement tools can be employed to establish baselines (e.g., a greenhouse gas inventory) and future assessments can ensure that targets are being met. From the baseline metric, all governmen- tal and community programs and sectors can and should be active participants in the sustainability process. Targets are more difficult to establish, so in some cases it is important to begin by tracking data. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, its annual State of Our Environment Report highlights the direction in which the citys indicators are heading. Burlington, Ver- mont started its planning process in 2000, setting a 10 percent greenhouse gas re- duction by 2005, and established goals based on this over-arching target.

Are the potential changes predominantly in one category (e.g., Energy Conservation and Atmospheric Quality) or are they randomly distributed (e.g., in all categories A-E)?  Are the potential changes mostly Red or Yellow, as indicated by the assessment of the specific questions? How many Reds versus Yellows are there?  How many changes can the local government potentially handle at a given time? To answer this question consider whether:  The local government has a large enough staff to develop and implement the changes.  The local government has the resources needed to develop and implement the changes.  The staff has the technical expertise required to make the changes within each of the five Categories.  It is more efficient to bundle the changes or implement them one-by-one over time.  How many potential changes are identified as under county or state jurisdiction? Codes adopted from the County may be easier to influence and change rather than codes adopted from state regulations.

Like a sustainability plan, these plans provide a vi- sion for the long-term development of the municipality and include land use, infrastructure, and natural  resources plans. However, these plans historically have focused on controlling and guiding development, not addressing energy use, climate change, or natural resource issues. Nor have they typically included  policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissionsa central component to a sustainability plan.
