        <!-- Updated Instruction Set -->
        <p>
            In this study, we have a set of US congressional bills that cover policies on various topics. We want to understand the various policy topics the government aims to implement. We will first ask you some questions to test your knowledge about the subject before you have access to the data. Then you will label these documents into different topics with the help of an AI tool. The labels will help you and us understand the distribution of policy topics that Congress cares about. You will then use what you have learned from the dataset to answer the questions again. Afterwards, you will be directed to a survey and complete the study.
        </p>

                You will start with a base pay of $8 for your participation. Additionally, we offer a performance-based incentive for the quality of your contributions. For EACH question you answer that is closely aligned with the actual dataset and meets our standards for high quality, you will earn an additional $2. This performance bonus aims to reward accurate responses that demonstrate a good understanding of the dataset.

                It's important to keep in mind that AI-assisted tools may sometimes generate false or inaccurate information. As such, the information provided by the tool should be treated as a starting point for further analysis and verification.

        <!-- AI-Assisted Tool Explanation -->
        <h4>The AI-Assistant will automatically help you:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Automatically picks paper abstracts sequentially to show you to label.</li>
            <li>Generate a list of label suggestions and summary for the abstract.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Task List -->
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the AI label suggestions to help you identify the topic within the selected abstract that addresses the questions we asked.</li>
            <li>Think about the pre-test questions while labeling documents.</li>
            <li>Either assign an existing label you made to a document or create a new label.</li>
            <li>Use the labels you created to assist you in answering the pre-test questions we asked.</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Guidelines for Labeling -->
        <h4>Guidelines for Labeling:</h4>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <p>
                Each label should be a short phrase (a label) rather than a long description. For example, <strong>Healthcare Insurance</strong> is a general category, while <strong>Healthcare Act of 2013 to promote accessible healthcare resources for veterans</strong> would be a description explaining the label, not the label itself. Label the topic associated with the documents.
