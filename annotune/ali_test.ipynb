This Workbook helps managers to systematically and  progressively develop and build that information into an action plan.

Organizational goals are the focus of concern. Goals are why organizations exist and what motivates  them; goals provide a context for changes. The vulnerability assessment half of a risk-based adaptation  plan is different from a climate change impacts study that describes how the future will be different if  the climate is different. An impact that is identified without reference to a goal is just a detail. There is no  context to say it is good or bad or that something should be done about it or not. Context comes from  people or organizations. They can say that an impact will help, hurt or have no effect on what they are  trying to do (Table I-1).

The Climate Ready Estuaries Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas, as well as other  documents (see the Additional Resources section of this step and Step 8a), will provide a sense for  what might work for your location and combination of risks. You might also recognize that some actions  address more than one risk.

A fair amount of  work remains in Step 8a and Step 8b before you will select a specific  mitigation technique to use. Do not be too critical right now. In the same  way the Workbook advises not to dismiss risks while you are preparing  your vulnerability assessment, you should not dismiss actions here right  now. You will be tempted to bring in your organizations context or other  knowledge to eliminate possible actions. However, judgments about how  realistic something is will be coming back into this very soon.

You need to  be prudent as well as aware that how you choose to approach your risks will determine where your  adaptation actions are focused going forward. Your context and constraints will have a big influence on the approach you select. It will be helpful to  consult partners and stakeholders as you determine the approach for each risk. Some risks may be very  important to a stakeholder group, or work may already be underway to address other risks. It will also be  helpful to consider the spatial scale of the impact. You may opt for a different approach depending on  whether it affects a small or large area.  Risk management uses four general approaches for responding to any given risk:  Mitigate.  Transfer.  Accept.  Avoid. Mitigating a risk is the one approach in which your organization would be making changes to the risk  path (Step 3). The other approaches handle risk more administratively.',\n",
       " '11': 'Transfer Transfer is a technical risk management term for having another organization take responsibility for  reducing the risk. Your risk is mitigated by another party. Buying an insurance policy is an example of  transferring risk by having another party reduce the consequences if the risk occurs. An environmental  management organization will probably not be buying insurance policies, but transfers can occur when  other organizations will act in ways to reduce your risks. Maybe your risk could be mitigated when a  highway is rebuilt or as part of other infrastructure work. Maybe you can agree to lead a reforestation  effort if a partner agrees to restore some other habitat. Maybe some agency has announced it will  be taking hazard mitigation actions that would have the co-benefit of reducing some of your risk. If  others actions are lowering the likelihood or consequence of your risks then you have transferred the  risk reduction responsibility to them. You arent mitigating the risk, but it is being reduced. Note that  you cannot unilaterally transfer a risk. Other organizations need to affirm that they will actually mitigate  the risk; otherwise the risk will still be there. You can opt to transfer some of a risk by partnering with  another organization or by making a financial contribution to someone elses mitigation project. If you  are working with partner organizations on your adaptation plan, this is an opportunity to decide which  organization is going to be the lead for which risks.',\n",
       " '12': 'Accept You may have to consider accepting a risk if you are unable to mitigate or transfer it through a viable  strategy. Accepting a risk means that your organization will continue with business as usual and run the  risk, dealing with the impact if/when it does occur. You might choose to accept a risk for some time,  and then later begin to work on mitigating it. Reasons to accept a risk could include a long time horizon  before impacts are expected, inability to locate a suitable mitigation strategy, or a lack of worry about  the consequence of the risk. If more resources or information become available, you can re-evaluate and  decide if there is an opportunity to use another approach besides accept for a risk.  If you dont make a choice to use any other approach, then by default you have elected to accept a risk.  You are running the risk',\n",
       " '13': 'Avoid The mitigate/transfer/accept approaches assume that you do not want to change your organizations  goals. If those three approaches are not feasible for you, then you may want to avoid a risk by narrowing  goals that are related to this risk. Avoiding is about being out of the risk altogether so it will not affect  you. Typically, avoiding a risk involves eliminating its root cause. However, since your organization by  itself will not stop climate change from occurring, and since you cannot relocate your place, avoiding  a risk in this context would require a shift in your organizations operations or goals so that you are no  longer exposed to that risk. For example, if one of your goals is to maintain some resource, but you  conclude that climate change is making that a lost cause, you could relinquish that goal. Avoiding a  risk does not mean the impact to the resource or to your place goes awaythis is an administrative  handling of risk in which you move away from this objective and you will no longer put resources toward  it. Avoiding a risk may be a radical move for an organization: you will be pulling back from work that you  thought was important. Reserve this approach for risks that will not be mitigated (by you or others) and  where accepting the risk is a bad proposition.',\n",
       " '14': 'Avoid vs. accept The Workbook often states that if more information becomes available you should go back to earlier  steps. In the iterative process of risk management, choosing avoid for a risk appears to be something  new that has lots of other implications for your adaptation plan. If you are renouncing a goal, then all the  risks you identified in Step 3, which derive from that goal, would seem to vanish too. Thus those risks  would fall out of your matrix and vulnerability assessment. If they are not in your vulnerability assessment,  they would not make it into this step of action planning either. Logically, deciding to avoid a risk makes it  and everything related to it disappear. Instead of acting right away on this logic, you should let your choice of avoid sit for now. The  implications to your risks and goals arising from an iteration do not go away but are not an immediate  problem. Instead, you want to leave open the possibility that even more information could be coming.  The risk may turn out to be more benign than you thought; a new risk mitigation technology might  emerge; a new partner may agree to help you with the risk; windfall funding might come in; etc. If you  expunge the risk and the goal from your vulnerability assessment and action plan, you have nothing to  go back to if you do get more information. Keep the risk and the goal, and keep track of the fact that  you chose to avoid the risk. Things might change that would eventually let you select a mitigate/transfer/ accept approach.  Tracking a risk you choose to avoid keeps a goal on the books. You stop working on the goal itself but  do not drop it completely. Pragmatically, it really does not matter what your goal is or is not if you are  not going to put any resources into trying to reach it. The difference between the accept and avoid  approaches to a climate change risk thus become the difference between business as usual toward a  goal and no action toward a goal. Tabl',\n",

If you are not sure about mitigation: You are not obligated to start responding, but if you think you  would want to mitigate a risk in the future, then you could benefit from the risk management process  now by assigning it to the mitigation approach. In the systematic risk management process, only those  risks that you identify for mitigation will be carried forward to Step 8a and Step 8b, where you will select  adaptation actions for the risks, and to Step 9, where you will develop your plan. The other riskswhich  you are deciding not to actively mitigate but to transfer/accept/avoidwill be picked up in Step 10 Monitoring and Review after you write your plan. If Step 8a and Step 8b show you that there is not a  viable mitigation strategy for a particular risk, you can return to this step and choose another approach',\n",
       " '16': 'Approving the approach After you have investigated and chosen a high-level approach (mitigate/transfer/accept/avoid) for every  one of your risks, your organizations key decision-makers (board of directors, management committee,  staff, and the people who are regularly involved with deciding what you do) should agree before you go  further with your action plan. Your organization is preparing a major strategy document. While this is not  a new strategic plan, it is a statement of how you plan to continue being able to achieve your mission  and goals.  If you selected the avoid approach for any of your risks, you need to carefully think through what this  means. You have chosen to withdraw from whatever goal would be thwarted by the risk. This may be  the whole goal if the goal is narrow (e.g., maintain critical habitat for a particular bird species), or it may  be a part of a goal if the goal is broad (e.g., maintain ecological diversity in your watershed). If you are  deciding to withdraw from pursuing a goal (and thereby in effect rewriting your strategic plan), key  decision-makers should approve this change in course.',\n",

You are looking for actions to apply at the relevant spots in the risk path in order to lower the likelihood  or consequence of a risk. Your professional knowledge and training may lead you in certain directions. As you were familiarizing  yourself with options in Step 7, additional ideas may have interested you. If your organization goals are  similar to the Clean Water Act goals, then Table 8a-1 of the Workbook presents the actions from CREs  Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas in a new format that you might find useful. If your  organization has goals specific to the management of water utilities, see resources from EPAs Climate  Ready Water Utilities program. For other sets of organizational goals, the Additional Resources section  at the end of this step points to sources of potential actions.  There are hundreds of potential actions that would alter a risk path and reduce the risks consequence/ probability. Many actions are trivial; some are practically impossible. You want to identify a plausible  range of actions in this step. This is probably not as open-ended a brainstorming exercise as it sounds,  but do not reject things that are novel. You want a range of actions because in Step 8b you may decide  that some are unpalatable for various reasons and should be rejected. Having a plausible range of  actions will help you find opportunities to use actions that might mitigate more than one risk, bring  co-benefits, or open up other opportunities. The best way to solve one particular risk might not be  as advantageous as a second-best way that mitigates other risks too. It is fine (probably desirable) to  identify the same action for more than one risk',\n",

The first table (Table 9-1) tracks the actions and notes  which risks they are associated with as well as who has  responsibility for implementing them. An action may  address more than one risk. The second table (Table 9-2) keeps track of your risks and  notes what actions are being used and when they are  completed. A risk may be affected by more than one  action.

LCP pol- icies generally influence a communitys day-to-day land use decisions  and capital facilities expenditures. These policies play a major role in  determining local development patterns, which in turn determine the  degree to which people and property are exposed to natural hazards,  injury, and damage. Examples of communities who have already incor- porated AAAs in their LCP are included in Chapter 3.6, Best Practices. Florida local agencies are now required to integrate or add accom- modations for the 2015 Peril of Flood Statute [163.3178(2)(f) 1-6]  into their Local Comprehensive Plan.

Implementation strategies are the specific steps a community takes to  incorporate the adaptation strategies into existing planning, budgeting,  and staffing mechanisms. The Assess Adaptive Capacities sub-com- ponent (Chapter 3.1) should outline the ability of the community to  take action. Even before the Vulnerability Assessment is conducted,  communities may want to consider possible implementation strate- gies based on available capacities, existing implementation schedules,  or available funding sources. Communities must be able to support  and implement adaptation activities to successfully reduce the neg- ative impacts of potential sea level rise that were identified during a  Vulnerability Assessment.

Specific geographic areas that are of the highest risk, (either due to their low elevations or proximi- ties to retreating cliffs), should be mapped and de- lineated, and timelines should be established for  actions that are based on agreed-upon conditions  or thresholds. For example, by the time high tides  reach a certain elevation, a relocation plan has  been established and action is initiated. Further- more, when a retreating cliff or bluff edge erodes to within a certain distance of a street, sidewalk,  sewer or water line, a clear retreat plan has been  approved. The team should remember to focus primar- ily upon planned or proactive adaptation, as op- posed to reactive adaptation. Reactive adapta- tion includes changes in policy and behaviors that  people and organizations adopt after changes in  coastal risks are observed or communities have  already sustained damage. For example, as prop- erty losses from increasing wave heights and in- creasingly severe coastal storms and sea level  rise increase in frequency, insurance companies  will likely raise their rates or drop coverage alto- gether, resulting in a disincentive to live in hazard  zones. This has already begun to happen along the  hurricane-prone barrier islands that line the South  Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The  purpose of adapting to sea level rise, though, is to  avoid such problems altogether by planning ahead  for the future.

In general, it is prudent to keep track  of any unexpected problems, obstacles or delays  associated with adaptation actions, as well as any  unintended positive or negative consequences. Another important consideration is that sea level  rise preparedness is a long-term and continuous  process. A Team must adjust its original assump- tions as natural, social, economic and political  conditions change. For instance, a Team will likely  come across new scientific information or data that could improve and possibly change its under- standing of its communitys vulnerability to sea  level rise.

Connecting to metrics and aid in tracking and monitoring progress of the  project through implementation. Leveraging existing community goals, such as those in a local compre- hensive plan, can help ensure alignment, and can rally a broader base of  support amongst stakeholders who have already bought into existing  goals or priorities.

This includes  existing budget planning as part of mainstream operations. Incrementally, resilience  projects and initiatives need to be part of the regular budget and decision-making  discussions.  Examine all funding sources at hand as possible resilience monies that can open  new possibilities to implement projects more quickly. Comb through internal budget  sources and consider how to re-purpose existing funds or create new revenue  scenarios to leverage whats already available.  Influence community-wide conversation and day-to-day decisions about long-term  capital improvements to both inform the public and build support for future funding  campaigns. Every community has an investment approach shaped by local values, identified risks,  and consensus solutions resulting from local dialogue. Developing a zero-based local  budget analysis to closely examine resources at hand can be the gateway to advance a  diverse resilience funding strategy.

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs),  regional land trusts, community foundations, and Community Development Corporations  (CDCs) are all potential partners in the initial project phase.  CDFIs, CDCs, land trusts, and community foundations can form a layer of the stack  that bridges local need to grants, revolving loan funds, or private sector investments.

Another example is the Rebuild North Bay organization that supports  fire recovery work to restore regional housing after the 2017 Wine Country Fires. Partnering with a boundary organization can help local governments find early funds to  jumpstart projects. Boundary organizations are common for bridging science and policy,  and these organizations can also function to bring diverse partners together for collabo- ration in areas that neither side is an expert in.

From there, identify components of projects that align grantors funding  priorities and tailor an application to those priorities. Other portions of the project  can then be covered by previously identified, re-allocated local funds or through other  matching grant or loan programs.',\n",

Tracking success and evaluating actions are critical elements in ensuring effective imple- mentation of resilience strategies and projects, meeting local needs, securing sound  investments, and ensuring people work together effectively. Identifying what to measure  (metrics), and how to track and evaluate those metrics over time is central to quantifying  results. Good metrics provide:    A baseline that indicates the starting point;    A target for where the community is going;   An indication if there is something wrong; and    Highlights when the agency or city achieves its goal.  Further, well designed metrics can help tell a story for why resilience building is  necessary, attract political support and funding, and focus efforts while providing a  feedback mechanism about whether decisions, investments, and actions to improve resil- ience are making a difference and can help guide future decisions. Good metrics should  be designed to do the following:    Connect to goals, community values, and desired outcomes.    Feasibly track information required to measure the metric. If the data is too difficult or  expensive to track and gather, it does not help.    Mean something and not simply a count. For example, a metric that indicates a  number of people who receive training does not necessarily correlate to knowledge.   Offer fewer, more meaningful metrics rather than a laundry list that will not be  tracked.   Provide data for accountability, guiding action, telling a story, and measuring success.

However, an output metric does not necessarily demonstrate the quality or success of a  strategy only that something has been done.  An outcome based metric, on the other hand, is more qualitative and tends to measure  the value and effectiveness of a strategy.

Other organizations use the term green infrastructure for  nature-based solutions to urban stormwater pollution. These  organizations emphasize solutions that protect water quality  and aquatic habitat. The other outcomes, such as mitigating  natural hazards, are seen as co-benefits.

Typically, stormwater  fees are collected in a fund dedicated to the stormwater  management program and stormwater-related projects.  This can be a good, steady source of funding that does  not compete with other community priorities.  Many stormwater utilities are structured to charge users  based on their propertys stormwater runoff volume.  For example, communities can charge a fee based on a  propertys impervious area, rather than its total area. For  this type of fee structure, communities need to have a  good understanding of their impervious cover. Stormwater  utilities are also able to collect fees from all property owners,  including those otherwise exempt from property taxes.

The EPA provides funding to all 50 states and Puerto Rico  to operate CWSRF programs. States provide a 20-percent  match for all federal funds. Since the CWSRF was established,  it has supplied more than $43 billion to state programs.  With that support, states have given $133 billion in loans  to communities.  For most projects, public, private, and non-profit entities  get an average interest rate of 1.4 percent. The loan period  must not exceed 30 years.

Linking any partnership  with performance-based payments can encourage  efficiencies in time and cost.  Local officials can work with private partners to develop and  finance nature-based solutions in many ways. One key step  is to demonstrate the benefits of nature-based solutions  to  make the business case locally. Another is to offer continued  technical assistance and coordination for nature-based  projects. This may include policy support, training, or other  ways to build capacity. Finally, seek long-term agreements  with any private stakeholders that would provide these  services traditionally delivered by the public sector. Above all,  communities should create partnerships with private parties  for specific projects.',\n",
       " '317': \"Rebates and Financing Programs Rebates, tax credits, or low-interest loans can encourage  nature-based solutions and practices. For example, Tucson  Water sponsors a Rainwater Harvesting rebate program. It  provides rebates of up to $2,000 to single-family residential  or small commercial customers who install a rainwater  harvesting system. Eligible options include passive rainwater  harvesting, which directs and retains water in the landscape,  and active rainwater harvesting, such as tanks that store  water for later use. Often, participants in this kind of program  need capital at the beginning of a project. Since residents  may not want or be able to fund improvements on their  own, many communities target their rebates and loans at  businesses. Philadelphia, for example, offers low interest  (1 percent) loans for nature-based solutions retrofits on  non-residential property.  Another finance option for promoting nature-based solutions  is the Department of Energy's Property Assessed Clean  Energy (PACE). Communities can use PACE to help property  owners finance nature-based solutions. It also applies to  installing renewable energy or energy-efficient assets on  private properties. Depending on state laws, communities  can create PACE programs by issuing a revenue bond to the  property owner. PACE borrowers can benefit immediately  from new nature-based solutions and repay their debt by  increasing property taxes. For example, increases are at a  set rate for an agreed-upon term, typically 525 years. The  PACE assessment is attached as a tax on the property, not  the property owner. Because PACE is funded through private  loans or municipal bonds, it creates no liability to local  government funds.\",\n",

In practice, most EIBs function like  traditional bonds, with a fixed interest rate and term. Unlike  normal bonds, they offer investors a performance payment  if projects perform better than expected. The primary benefit  of this model is that it shifts the project performance risk to  a private party and ties borrowing costs to the effectiveness  of a project. If a project underperforms, investors must  reimburse the borrowing entity; if it overperforms, the entity  pays the investors. This model has potential applications for  multiple areas of environmental restoration and resilience,  including nature-based solutions.',\n",

Zoning incentives can allow a greater height,  density, or intensity of development if a developer uses  nature-based approaches. One common zoning incentive  is an increased floor-to-area ratio (FAR), which regulates  the density of development on a site. The City of Portland,  Oregon offers increased FAR as an incentive for installing  green roofs. Communities can also exempt green roofs  or pervious pavements from any regulations that apply to  impervious cover.  More incentives for adopting nature-based solutions  approaches can be used in the development application  and review period.

Hazard mitigation reduces disaster damages and is defined as  sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk  to human life and property from hazards. Outreach programs  that increase risk awareness, projects to protect critical facilities,  and the removal of structures from flood hazard areas are all  examples of mitigation actions.

These mitigation policies and actions are identified  based on an assessment of hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks and  the participation of a wide range of stakeholders and the public  in the planning process. Benefits of mitigation planning include:  Identifying actions for risk reduction that are agreed upon  by stakeholders and the public.  Focusing resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities.

Your  community can develop its own single jurisdiction plan or work with neighboring jurisdictions on a multi- jurisdictional plan.  Establish the Planning Area The planning area refers to the geographic area covered by the plan. Generally, the planning area follows local  government1  jurisdictional boundaries, such as cities, townships, counties, or planning districts. However, planning  areas also may be defined by watersheds or other natural features, particularly where hazards create similar risks  across jurisdictional boundaries. A jurisdictions boundaries may also cross over or encompass other jurisdictions,  such as a fire protection district or a utility district.  The State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO)2  or State emergency management agency can help communities  determine the appropriate planning area. This determination may be based on State planning goals and planning  grant funding priorities.  Mitigation Plan Updates  If you are updating your communitys plan, determine if the planning area defined in the previously approved  plan is still appropriate.

Although not required, some communities choose to develop  objectives to help define or organize mitigation actions (see  Figure 6.2). Objectives are broader than specific actions, but  are measurable, unlike goals. Objectives connect goals with  the actual mitigation actions, as shown in the example.',\n",

Mitigation activities lessen or eliminate the need for preparedness or response resources in the  future.

Examples include:  Creating mutual aid agreements with neighboring communities to meet emergency response needs.  Purchasing radio communications equipment for the Fire Department.  Developing procedures for notifying citizens of available shelter locations during and following an event. For some hazards, such as tornados, including preparedness actions in the mitigation plan may be necessary  and practical. The mitigation plan may be the best place for your community to capture and justify the need for  these actions.

As described in Task 5, these impacts and vulnerabilities  may be summarized in problem statements. Some hazards may not  have many impacts, or the impacts may already be mitigated.

For  example, building retrofits, infrastructure protection, and changes in local ordinances represent a mix of structural  and non-structural approaches. In addition, each jurisdiction must consider actions that reduce risk to existing  buildings and infrastructure, as well as limit risk to new development and redevelopment.  The planning team may identify low-cost mitigation actions that can be readily implemented, such as developing  an outreach program to encourage homeowners to secure furnishings and utilities to prevent injuries and damage  during an earthquake. Other actions may depend on available funding, such as retrofitting critical infrastructure.  Though funding and support may not be immediately available for every action, including the actions in the plan  may lead to future opportunities for implementation. For example, some actions can be implemented following a  disaster when additional funding and political and public support are available, such as acquiring homes in a flood  hazard area. Additionally, if actions are not included in the plan, securing funding may be more difficult once it  becomes available. To identify potential mitigation actions, the planning team needs to review the risk assessment and assess  capabilities.  1. Review Risk Assessment The planning team should start with the problem statements developed from the risk assessment. For each problem  statement, consider different types of mitigation actions for addressing the problem. See the example on the page  6-6.  You may have multiple ideas that are categorized under one type (e.g., education and awareness or local plans and  regulations) and no ideas under another type.

Assess Capabilities The mitigation strategy is based on existing local authorities, policies, programs, and resources, as well as the ability  to expand on and improve these existing tools. As part of Task 4, the planning team reviewed existing capabilities for  reducing long-term vulnerability to hazards. Those capabilities can be assessed to identify gaps to be addressed and  strengths to enhance through new mitigation actions. For instance, can gaps in design or enforcement of existing  regulations be addressed through additional personnel or a change in procedure or policy? Could an existing  education program be improved to cover the most significant hazards and better target non-English speakers? Are  additional studies, reports, or plans needed to understand risk?  Jurisdictions participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can consider actions to enhance their  floodplain management program, such as addressing repetitive loss properties and improving standards beyond the  minimum requirements for NFIP participation.  Communities also must consider actions that reduce risk to future development. The planning team can evaluate  the effects of current growth plans and regulations (i.e., comprehensive plans, zoning and subdivisions ordinances,  building codes, and capital improvement programs) on community safety and consider how these could be updated  to reduce the communitys vulnerability. For instance, development review procedures may be revised to include a  hazard assessment for new development. The types of questions that the community can ask include:  Will population growth and future land use plans put more people in hazardous areas?  Will current redevelopment policies increase the population and property vulnerable to hazards?  Will planned infrastructure extensions encourage unsafe development by facilitating access to hazardous areas?',\n",

Assign Responsible Agency The planning team needs to determine which department or  agency is most appropriate to lead each action. In order to clearly  describe how actions will be implemented and administered,  at a minimum, a specific agency, department, or position must  be assigned to the action, not the jurisdiction as a whole.

Appendix  A includes an example worksheet for reporting progress on a mitigation action (see Worksheet 7.1).  The planning team must identify the lead position or agency, usually the same individual or agency leading the  plans development, for coordinating the monitoring process. A method and schedule for regular monitoring can  include reports or other deliverables and expectations for meeting attendance. Monitoring, therefore, becomes part  of the regular administrative function of the offices or positions to which it is assigned',\n",

The planning team must identify how, when, and by  whom the plan will be updated. Documenting the procedures for updating the plan requires an explanation of who  will be responsible for updating the plan and when and how this process will be initiated. The plan must include  the title of the individual or name of the department or agency responsible for leading the updating effort. It may  be appropriate to include a schedule of activities that allows sufficient time to obtain funding for and complete the  planning process before the plan expires.  The planning team can also establish procedures for updating the plan following a disaster event or concurrent with  the development of a recovery or post-disaster redevelopment plan. Your communitys vulnerabilities and mitigation  priorities often change following a disaster, and additional funding sources may become available, such as FEMAs  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or Public Assistance. Generally, public awareness increases, and the demand and  support for mitigation frequently increases following a disaster. You may choose to take advantage of opportunities  to incorporate mitigation into recovery strategies and to rebuild wisely and safely to avoid similar losses in the  future. This is also an important time to collect data on the hazard and its impacts for future plan updates.

Using a step-by-step discussion of the planning process, this guide introduces  principles underlying preparedness and recovery planning, describes topics to be considered as part of the  planning process, and identifies specific organization-building and planning activities. Achieving fundamental recovery preparedness, involves application of six standard planning process steps  as well as several associated key recovery activities. The key activities are intended to serve as additional  considerations that expand on the overarching six planning steps, as illustrated in the graphic below, and  focus more specifically on the challenges and unique partnerships necessary for successful pre-disaster  recovery planning. In the following chapters this guide provides guidance for applying these steps and  activities in a scalable fashion in large to small communities. The planning process introduced and discussed in this guide directly aligns with the process outlined in  Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans: Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG 101). This guide is  formatted to follow the six steps of CPG 101 and presents six standard planning steps in Chapters 7 through  12 and then presents key recommended activities that are specific to pre-disaster recovery planning efforts.  Figure 1 can help to serve as a basic orienting checklist for preparing for recovery.',\n",
       " '380': 'The planning process should incorporate the results of other applicable planning processes in the  community and region. Hazard mitigation plans, comprehensive plans, housing plans, and other  planning documents can define a wide range of goals for the community and represent shared priorities  of community members. Linking recovery planning to build on the communitys existing plans helps  inform recovery planning efforts and capitalize on past planning efforts so as not to reinvent the wheel.  Additionally, linking recovery planning with other applicable planning processes helps to incorporate  community perspectives. Recovery activities can then in turn be used to inform revisions to the  communitys other plans. Including the whole community in the pre-disaster recovery planning process  means including all sectors of the community. Many existing Federal programs relate to disaster recovery. While many of these programs are voluntary for  communities, the requirements for participation could benefit communities when they develop their pre- disaster recovery plan. For example, the Economic Development Administration requires communities to  produce Community Economic Development Strategies, and the Department of Health and Human Services  has preparedness requirements for communities that relate to disaster recovery. A pre-disaster recovery  planning process would build upon these existing efforts.  Figure 2 outlines the relationship between existing plans, like those mentioned above, and the pre-disaster  recovery plan. In addition, the figure explains how these existing plans and the pre-disaster recovery plan  are used after a disaster to support the development of post-disaster recovery plans, policies, and projects.',\n",
       " '381': 'RECOVERY PLANNING IS GOAL ORIENTED Thorough, comprehensive, and community-supported pre-disaster recovery plans allow a locality to  more easily and effectively begin the recovery process immediately after a disaster. The development and  documentation of recovery planning goals, including the partnerships necessary to achieve those goals,  help recovery stakeholders understand existing capabilities and gaps. Equally important is the development  of realistic goals. Although a community may have its own resources or partner resources at its disposal,  the resources available to recover effectively are finite. Goal development in both the pre-disaster and  post-disaster environments needs to account for the availability of resources so that they may be leveraged  strategically to achieve desired outcomes. Appendix F includes a template that can be used to document  existing capabilities as they relate to recovery goals and the partnerships and resources in place (or not  currently in place) to achieve those goals.  In addition to determining capability gaps, using a goal-oriented process for pre-disaster recovery planning  helps to build consensus among the involved stakeholders. Establishing common, mutually agreeable,  strategic goals early in the planning process reduces conflicts when the plan is implemented in a post- disaster setting.',\n",

Communities that have minimal resources to  manage recovery but many vulnerabilities and risks will want to emphasize partnership-building in the  planning process and seek assistance from State or regional bodies. Communities with a high capacity to  manage recovery will want to emphasize local roles and responsibilities in facilitating the recovery process  and may be in a position to develop a robust recovery plan. Pre-disaster recovery plan components such as recovery goals and policies, administrative structure, and  activation of personnel (see Appendix E) will vary depending on the capacity of the community and the  partnerships needed or already in place. Operational guidance included in the pre-disaster recovery plan  should also consider the different phases of disaster management, transition from or coordination with  response coordination structures, and identify times when recovery operations peak and when they begin  to wind down. An example of a scalable recovery system is shown in Figure 3.',\n",
       " '383': 'RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY A truly holistic recovery process must include activities that support building community resilience and  encouraging sustainable development. This concept can be implemented in recovery planning efforts  through coordination with mitigation planning. Mitigation is a sustained action eliminating or reducing  potential effects of hazards, and mitigation planning attempts to identify those hazards, reduce any impacts  from those hazards, and identify potential solutions. Thus mitigation planning, pre-disaster recovery  planning, and other types of planning have parallel perspectives with overarching recovery goals of:  Increasing the speed of community recovery;  Effectively using resources; and  Increasing opportunities for community betterment that take into account and balance all community populations, needs, and risks. A successful mitigation program and other pre-disaster planning can set the stage for a more sustainable  and resilient community by positioning the community to be able to adapt to changing conditions, identify  future natural and human-related disaster threats and hazards, and withstand and rapidly recover from  disruption due to future emergencies.

Suggested questions for community self-assessment,  framed around the cross-cutting Recovery Core  Capabilities, are included in Table 3. Completing  this evaluation and comparing identified needs  to established roles and existing community  resources allows the community to identify gaps.

For example, expertise related to community development,  housing, community planning, social services, disability access, historic preservation, identifying funding  sources, grant writing, public administration, and financial management are particularly important in  developing a robust pre-disaster recovery plan. Some questions to consider when evaluating staff resources include:   What staffing resources are available to assist with the increased workload associated with recovery activities?  Does current staff have subject matter expertise necessary to undertake recovery activities, develop new programs, or organize complex long-term projects?  Do all city departments fully understand their roles in recovery and redevelopment?  What organizational structures already exist within partner organizations to manage recovery?

As financial aspects of disaster recovery are evaluated, some questions to consider include:   What current local government and NGO financial resources are available to use for potential recovery activities?  Are contingency plans available for continuity of the operation of local government and/ or NGOs over an extended period of time?

Formalizing authority legitimizes the pre-disaster recovery plan and  indicates commitment by local leadership. Authority and responsibility of designated recovery leaders  should also be clearly defined. This step can be accomplished by developing a recovery ordinance, which  grants the recovery organization the authority to implement recovery planning activities after a disaster  strikes.

The built environment supports vital social and economic  functions such as shelter, food, education, healthcare, business and government. Community services and functions  need to recover as quickly as possible, preferably within a specified period of time set by each community.  When recovery of key services and functions is delayed, community residents  face increasing challenges to remaining in the community.

The desired performance goals are expressed as recovery times and should  build on the social and economic characteristics and needs of the community  from Step 2. For example:  The desired performance for critical facilities, such as emergency rooms and 911 call centers, is typically  continuous service or minimal disruption after a hazard event.   Most residents should be able to shelter in their homes or in emergency housing after a hazard event, and  utility services should be restored in a maximum of one or two weeks to keep residents in the community.   Small businesses and major employers need to resume within one-to-two weeks to maintain the economy;  schools and daycare need to have similar goals for resuming operations so all parents can work.   In contrast, it may be reasonable to set recovery times for non-emergency city services at weeks or months,  such as parks and recreation facilities. The desired recovery time between a hazard event and the recovery of community functions and services is  independent of the type of hazard. For instance, the desired recovery time for a hospital or utility will be the same for a  range of hazards (e.g., flood, hurricane, earthquake).

For example, any upsizing of the regulator chamber or the  high point of the system can negatively impact the design and operation of the wastewater infrastructure and  residences/businesses on the system and can lead to a diminished level of service. DEP is in the process of developing a hydrologic and hydraulic (H&H) model to estimate runoff flow for future  climate scenarios and is evaluating rainfall hyetographs for the existing and future rainfall scenarios to be  included in the drainage planning process.

The main guiding principle in the development of the BCA methodologies included here was to balance  simplicity with accuracy. However, types of benefits can vary by climate hazard and by the type of facility;  benefit categories identified here may not cover all the potential benefits provided by every facility type within  New York City. In particular, the benefits of planning for increased precipitation are difficult to quantify and the  project design team should incorporate additional data as new inputs become available.  For projects with construction costs below $50 million, the project team is recommended to perform a  qualitative benefits assessment on the interventions that meet the Guidelines recommendations for all  applicable climate hazards.

It is assumed that the project design team will develop  alternatives to address each of the following applicable climate hazards - sea level rise/coastal storm surge,  increased precipitation and extreme heat - separately.  This assessment allows agencies to screen the qualitative benefits for various alternatives that would then  lead to development of final project components to match the available budget and goals of the project.  Use Table 5 as a template to evaluate resilient design alternatives using a set of general evaluation criteria  and metrics. Develop appropriate evaluation criteria and metrics for each of the project benefit categories  applicable to the capital project being assessed.

See Table 6 for an example of how to complete the template. The template can be customized to meet project  goals and objectives.  During the qualitative assessment, the project design team should assess how intervention strategies will  have varying levels of reliability, effectiveness, benefits, and cost implications.

In the past, public participation  processes did not necessarily reach all segments of the com- munity and may have been viewed by public agencies more  as a requirement to meet (for example, by conducting public  hearings) than as an opportunity to garner meaningful input.  This means that authentic participation processes may have to  overcome the perception that what participants say will not be  respected. Authentic participation programs go beyond the  minimum legal requirements to connect with citizens through  innovative communication and outreach channels, such as  creative use of the Internet and interactive workshops in loca- tions where people work and live.

Successful long-term planning also depends on  having a clear picture of a long-term mission and vision that includes aspects  of your coalitions structure or policy strategies that should be maintained or  improved (Lasker & Weiss, 2003). Consider expanding your definition around  sustainability to include the efforts of like-minded partners and organiza- tions; it may be work that they are already doing. However coalition members  decide to proceed, consider the following suggestions:   Determine what type of organization will best suit the needs of the  coalition for the long run (For more information see Module 3.

For coalitions just beginning their plan, ask members, external stakeholders, local groups, and com- munity members to fill out a connection mapa catalog of existing and potential community connections.  (See the HCC example on page 21). When looking for support and resources (e.g., funding, in-kind support,  people) to help achieve and sustain organizational or policy goals, consider using all or some of the assets and  connections available. Then review the maps with appropriate individuals to find any potential sustainability  connections; they may be willing to make the initial contact for you.

If youre not sure what a new organization can bring to the table, find the  right people from that organization and interview them to determine their interests and potential resources.

Ending or de-prioritizing an activity can  be difficult, especially if people are passionate about it. (Having a skilled, neutral facilitator can be helpful in  this situation). Remember that ending a particular effort is not necessarily a bad thing, because resources can  now be leveraged in a way that is more likely to meet community needs. Relish any small successes that came  from the effort and note what has been learned from it. This will help guide future coalition efforts.  Whatever the reason for de-prioritizing a strategy, the coalition should take steps to formally close it out (e.g.,  completing an evaluation and final report). This way, there will be a record of relevant decisions and actions in  case the strategy is revisited by other organizations seeking to do similar work.

Maybe its not feasible for your coalition to sustain so many strategies and activities  at once, or some dont precisely fit your criteria for continuation (see Step 5). Spinning off strategies to other organizations that will support them in the long run is a solid sustainability  goal (Goodman & Steckler, 1989).

Use fees to continue community improvements (DeJong & Davidson, 2000). For example, fees charged to  rent local park facilities can fund continuing after-school recreation activities.    Leverage existing funding sources with other local efforts. For example, ask school districts or city and  county governments to financially support efforts that fall within their own programs.

This includes planning a summary evalua- tion before an intervention begins, which helps to clarify program goals and reasonable outcomes. At this stage, evaluation will help you improve your PSE efforts and implementation. It is important to peri- odically assess and adapt your organizational structure and activities for achieving your policy objectives to  ensure they are as effective as possible. Evaluation can help you identify areas for improvement and ultimately  help you realize your goals more efficiently (Hornik, 2002; Noar, 2006).

       " '499': 'Why are policies important for sustainability? Policies can serve the concept of sustainability by providing long-term goals around which community  members can rally. A coalition should not only promote policies but also ensure that theyve been imple- mented as expected and are having the intended effect. Sustainability is, in large part, about developing momentum to maintain community-wide changes that  improve public health. Policy strategies are the most effective way to ensure long-term momentum. While individual approaches to behavior change are important for health promotion efforts, these changes  need to be prompted and supported by changes in environments, social norms, and networks that support  positive health decisions (Green, Richard, & Potvin, 1996; Stokols, 1996). Whether implemented in schools,  the community, or within community organizations, policy strategies can result in change on multiple lev- els, significantly impacting social and cultural norms and values (Swinburn, 2008; Stunkard & Pennick, 1979).  To achieve sustainability, a policy strategy needs to impact everyone in its priority population (Brownson,  2009). Policy strategies are a population-wide approach and can impact far more people than individual  strategies. Policies can also be replicated in multiple community settings and on many levels.  In addition, policy strategies are more economically sustainable long-term than other approaches (Swinburn,  2008). Once a policy has been implemented, few, if any, resources are usually needed to sustain resulting  community improvements. In fact, policy strategies can yield continuous improvements even if the institu- tions or coalitions that helped enact them are not themselves sustained (Holder & Moore, 2000, p. 75). For  these reasons, a policy approach is the best way to work toward sustainable change in the community.',\n",

This community home should  be able to: serve as an objective broker of public health resources; solicit and administer a variety of funding  sources; appeal to a variety of community-based organizations; establish an internal infrastructure; and shift  priorities to accommodate changes in goals and community needs. As long as these criteria are met, a community home could be located in a government branch, a communi- ty health 501(c)3 organization, or an existing not-for-profit or for-profit venture (e.g., hospital or foundation).

Process training can include such items  as team building, leadership training, communication, and project planning. Public health content can  include current strategies to promote specific efforts around chronic disease risk factors (e.g., tobacco use,  prevention, and control), physical activity and nutrition, understanding health equity, and elements of the  built environment. Coalition members can learn skills from self-help methods (e.g., e-learning) or through  face-to-face workshops that can help with strategic or program planning and process training.  Coalitions can use a variety of assessment processes to determine the best type of training, including sur- veys, coalition-wide discussions, consultation with coalition coordinators or technical assistance (TA) staff,  and a review of the literature on best practices.  The last two options are particularly important, because they provide an outside, objective perspective. TA  staff members often come from funding organizations.

When beginning  your coalitions social marketing plan, remember to keep the audiences perspective in mind and consider all  potential barriers to behavior change.  For your coalitions social marketing efforts to be successful, you need to know what can motivate a cer- tain population to adopt a desired behavior.

These goals should reflect internal  assessment of sustainability priorities as well as community sustainability priorities identified through  information gathering and consultation with local institutions and stakeholders. Utilities are also  encouraged to engage other municipal departments, as appropriate. For example, there may not be  enough biosolids generated by the utility to cost-effectively operate a digester, but in combination with  organics collected by the solid waste department, there may be enough energy generated to justify a  major equipment purchase.  Ideally, utility consultation with communities  and customers about sustainability goals occurs as part of ongoing engagement about  services, key decisions, and revenue needs.  Information gathering about community  sustainability priorities, however, can take  many forms, from review of existing  community plans or other documents to  direct consultation with community  representatives (e.g., planning agencies,  elected officials, and stakeholder groups).

Partnerships, either formal or informal, allow the utility and community not just to understand  each others priorities but also to enable each others activities. For example, the water utility that  serves Hidden Valley Lake, California worked over time to enhance drinking water source protection. It  ultimately influenced the nature and location of development through a role in land use permitting  under the direction of the local planning department (see call out box later in this section). Any of the approaches along this continuum can be used depending on the utilitys capacity and  resources, as well as local conditions.

Identify sustainability priorities and potential opportunities for the utility Utilities first consider their own sustainability priorities by internally assessing infrastructure and  operations that may provide opportunities for increased sustainability and improved performance. For  example, utilities may want to assess operations using the Effective Utility Management Primer  described in the Introduction to this handbook. Similarly, many aspects of a utilitys asset management  plan can provide useful information for identifying sustainability opportunities. A vulnerability  assessment can pinpoint opportunities for improved system resilience. It can also identify gaps in  technical, managerial, and financial capacity that, when address, can help utilities achieve sustainability  goals. For many utilities, sustainability priorities may focus almost exclusively on strategies for meeting  regulatory requirements or approaches for sustaining existing infrastructure and operations as opposed  to new projects.  Although Step 1 is internally focused, it can be informed by ongoing customer and community  relationships and their expectations about the role and operation of the utility. It can also be informed  by the range of incentives utilities have to become more sustainable, including cost savings, financial  benefits, and alignment with the utilities traditional mission or sustainability policies.',\n",

As part of considering these plans, utilities  should develop familiarity with the  community-wide priorities these plans  seek to address. Furthermore, utilities  should improve understanding of the institutions (and key contact personnel)  responsible for planning, and  opportunities for involvement in ongoing  planning processes (e.g., as part of  steering committees, or through direct  agency-to-agency dialogue).',\n",

Documentation can also help communicate  sustainability goals to boards, other oversight bodies, and utility employees. As utilities develop goals, maintaining regular communication with stakeholders and relevant regulatory  agencies will help lay the foundation for (and engender support for) subsequent decisions about specific  strategies and investment alternatives. A transparent decision-making process will help utilities gain the  support of the community.',\n",

Any vulnerabilities in  technical, managerial, or financial capacity of the utility that would preclude achieving sustainability  goals should be targeted for specific objectives and strategies. Measuring performance relative to  vulnerabilities is critical to achieving a sustainable course of action.  In some cases, utilities may want to  express sustainability objectives in  terms of specific quantitative  targets. For example, a utility may  want to reduce energy  consumption by 10 percent or  increase water efficiency by 25  percent. In other cases, a utility may want to develop procedural  objectives, such as developing  policies that target infrastructure  investments to existing  communities. Utilities may also  want to establish a procedural  objective to create a level playing  field among optionsincluding  those that are more sustainable.  For example, a utility could set an  objective to evaluate non- traditional project alternatives  (e.g., decentralized wastewater  solutions, green infrastructure for  stormwater, etc.) along with  conventional grey infrastructure  or to evaluate partnership  opportunities in any analysis of  system expansion options.',\n",

Ensure that objectives are SMART The most effective objectives are SMART:  Specific: Utilities specify exactly what they want to achieve  Measurable: Utilities are able to measure whether they are meeting the objectives  Attainable: Utilities can realistically achieve the objective in the time period specified  Realistic: Utilities can achieve the objective with the capacity, funding, and other resources available  Time-based: Utilities set a timeframe for achieving the objective An example of a SMART objective, which was developed by the City of Portland Water Bureau, is: Reduce the bureaus overall electrical use by 5 percent (excluding variation due to weather and  groundwater operation) by July 2012, compared to a 2005-08 baseline. While these objectives clearly establish a target, other types of objectives can be similarly SMART. For  example, a utility could establish an objective to evaluate green infrastructure alternatives for any  proposed infrastructure investment of over $10 million and revisit the investment threshold in five  years. Utilities should strive to set objectives that are achievable and realistic. They may, however, be  operating in an environment where information on their baseline and realistic objectives is lacking. In  this case, utilities may want to set provisional objectives that can be refined later. As part of a continual  improvement process, these objectives may be refined and adapted over time as more information is  gathered and project alternatives are evaluated and selected. For example, a utility may identify current  energy consumption and the relative costs and benefits of energy efficiency alternatives before setting a  specific target. Utilities with low hanging fruit may set an ambitious objective, while utilities with few  remaining low-cost efficiency options may set a more conservative target.',\n",

In  many cases, it may be useful to undertake a  basic brainstorming approach. As utilities begin this step, they should keep in  mind basic tips about brainstorming:  Dont judge, challenge, evaluate, or  criticize suggested strategies;   Emphasize the quantity of ideas, not  quality; and  Put analysis and organization in the background.',\n",

It allows utilities and local officials to make infrastructure decisions  consistent with sustainability goals and objectives best suited for the utility and the community. Alternatives analysis can be conducted at many  scales, from an analysis of system-wide  infrastructure alternatives to specific engineering  decisions about the repair, rehabilitation, or  replacement of specific equipment. The steps  and examples described below focus on project- level alternatives analysis linked to utility goals  and objectives but can be translated to different  scales. For alternatives analysis to be effective, utilities  need to establish explicit and consistent project  selection criteria for each sustainability objective.  Identifying and applying sustainability criteria is  the critical juncture at which utilities choose the  specific economic, environmental, and social  benefits they will weigh in selecting among  alternatives. A replicable, consistent, and  transparent approach will ensure that each  alternative is considered on a level playing field.  When done well, this approach will enable utilities to choose a mix of projects that meets  customers service expectations, optimizes the  sustainability of utility infrastructure and  operations, and supports other community  sustainability priorities whenever feasible.

In response, utilities can phase in green infrastructure  investments and then consider further deployment based on  what they learn about effectiveness and cost.

Riparian area protection and odor  control are considered equally importantand more important than construction-related disruptions.  The utility then gives a weight of 4 points each to riparian area protection and odor control, and 2 points  to non-obtrusive construction techniques.

Although these costs should have been fully  profiled during alternatives analysis, it is  important to thoroughly review the estimates  at this point in the process. This will ensure  revenue requirement estimates are fully  reflective of any changes in O&M costs  resulting from the new project(s). From a project financial sustainability point of  view, asset depreciation is an additional  operating cost area to consider. Establishing a  project depreciation expense, an area of  potential weakness in many revenue adequacy determinations, is critical to estimating revenue  requirements sufficient to replace aging infrastructure. Revenue requirements reflecting depreciation  costs can provide the means to establish and fund repair and replacement accounts. Underfunding predictive and preventive maintenance (i.e., failing to fully estimate costs as part of the  revenue requirements determination) is a key vulnerability of revenue adequacy determinations.  Ongoing condition assessment costs of any new infrastructure also need to be accounted for, consistent  with the utilitys asset management program requirements. Overall, maintenance costs will be unique  to the particular assets involved, but should be driven by the utilitys asset management program, which  will set the type and frequency of desired maintenance. Because underfunding predictive and  preventive maintenance is a common problem, thorough consideration of project maintenance costs  with the underpinning of the utilitys asset management program is critical to ensuring maintenance  needs are fully represented when establishing funding adequacy.

For example, conservation pricing has the potential to decrease utilization rates as customers  conserve water, which may reduce revenues and potentially make them less predictable.17 Step 4: Develop a capital financing strategy Similarly, an  economic downturn can reduce the number of utility customers or their ability to pay. This decreased  rate-paying base can place substantial financial pressure on the utility. An effective capital financing strategy is critical  to the financial sustainability of the selected  project alternatives and the utility system as a  whole. A utility should seek a capital financing  strategy that keeps capital acquisition and  interest costs as low as possible and keeps the  repayment schedule (principal and interest)  consistent with revenue capacity (cash flow).  The mix of financing options used by the utility  and how debt is structured will affect financial  sustainability. There are two basic building  blocks of an effective capital financing strategy:  1) identifying and comparing the full range of  project financing options available, and 2)  managing capital commitments and debt  structure on an ongoing basis consistent with  utility revenue capacity and borrowing conditions.',\n",

Four basic options exist for capitalization of proposed project(s): rates and other  utility direct revenue sources, federal or state loan or subsidy programs, revenue bonds, and state  grants. The mix of capitalization approaches used can substantially affect borrowing costs and  repayment schedules. In general, utilities have two choices when funding new capital investmentsusing revenues to pay as  you go for new investments, or using long-term debt financing. Under a pay as you go approach,  capitalization through utility rates and other revenues does not carry debt financing costs, but it is  typically reserved for routine replacement of existing facilities, system extensions, and basic  improvements that can fit comfortably into annual utility revenue capacity.

It is linked to prevailing borrowing  conditions and the phasing of capital project implementation. A utility, when structuring debt, should  consider prevailing and anticipated future bond market conditions (to the extent that revenue bonds are  an important element of the capital financing approach). Key variables a utility can manage, depending  on conditions, are the timing of borrowing, the amount of each increment of borrowing, and the mix of  interest and principal paid on an annual basis over the life of the repayment schedule. Maintaining  ongoing awareness of bond market conditions can provide refinancing opportunities throughout the life  of the project, particularly in cases where a utility has strategically deferred principal payments as a  result of financing during an unfavorable interest rate climate. Regardless of the public or private  financing option(s) selected, a utility can adjust project phasing, and therefore the associated annual  capital principal and interest cost requirements.

One broad rule of thumb is that it is usually best to start with the most pressing problems and those that lend themselves to the most direct and cost-effective solutions. Then use a systematic planning approach such as an environmental management system (EMS), described in the next sec- tion of this handbook, to continue to im- prove performance over time. It is also important to consider the full cost and full benefits of each approach to determine an accurate payback period. For example, preventing sewer overflows into rivers and seas can improve drink- ing water, aquatic-based commerce and tourism. Electricity and fuel-saving pro- grams can reduce operating costs, and re- cycling materials, like aluminum and cop- per, can be lucrative. The payback periods may be shorter than you think.

Requires the Supreme Court to eliminate the current model patent infringement complaint form from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\\n\\nDirects parties alleging infringement to include in their court pleadings specified details concerning:\\n\\n each claim of each patent allegedly infringed; each process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (\"accused instrumentalities\") alleged to infringe the claim; for each identified claim, a description of the elements alleged to be infringed by the accused instrumentality and how the accused instrumentality is alleged to infringe those elements; and for each claim of indirect infringement, the acts of the alleged infringer that contribute to or induce direct infringement. Requires courts, upon a motion, to dismiss claims that do not meet such pleading requirements unless a party with a plausible claim provides a general description of information that was inaccessible after a reasonable inquiry.\\n\\nRequires parties alleging infringement to disclose to the court, adverse parties, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO): (1) assignees of the patent and their ultimate parent entities, (2) entities and ultimate parent entities with a right to sublicense to unaffiliated entities or to enforce the patent; and (3) entities known to have a financial interest in the patent, the patentee, or any ultimate parent entity.

Permits petitioners to reply to new issues raised in a preliminary response.\\n\\nPermits the USPTO to choose not to institute a review that would not serve the interests of justice. Requires the USPTO to consider whether: (1) the grounds of unpatentability on prior art or arguments in the petition are substantially the same as those considered and decided in a prior judicial or USPTO proceeding involving the same claims, and (2) there is another proceeding involving the same patent pending before the USPTO. Prohibits an inter partes review from being instituted on the basis that the evidentiary standard before the USPTO differs from that used in a U.S. court. Allows a petitioner to petition to add additional patent claims in an instituted inter partes review if such petition is made within one year after that petitioner, or the real party in interest or privy of that petitioner, is served with an amended complaint for the first time alleging that any of them infringed the patent claims to be added. Binds inter partes and post-grant review parties in subsequent USPTO or court proceedings (or their real parties in interest or privy) to any representations they made regarding claim construction with respect to the prosecution history of the patent that were finally adopted by the USPTO in deciding the review. Directs the USPTO to prescribe regulations providing USPTO panels with the authority to determine whether to hear live testimony offered by a party to an inter partes or post-grant review if it would facilitate resolution of the case because genuine issues of material fact, conflicting expert opinions, or issues of witness credibility exist. Requires each claim of a patent to be construed as such claim would be in a civil action to invalidate a patent, including by construing each claim in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and the prosecution history pertaining to the patent. Directs the USPTO to consider previous claim constructions or determinations of U.S. courts in proceedings in which the patent owner was a party. Requires USPTO regulations to ensure that the panel adjudicating such review proceeding consists of not more than one individual who participated in the decision to institute such a proceeding. Allows such regulations to prescribe that the decision to institute a proceeding be made by designees of the USPTO Director other than members of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.
